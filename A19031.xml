            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, it is not unknowen, that when Thomas White publiſhed his Book, called <hi>A Diſcoverie of Browniſme,</hi> (as now againe of late, Chriſtopher Lawne &amp; others with him have done theirs) that there was an Inquirie &amp; Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of written by the Paſtour of this Church, wherein he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the particulars from point to point. In which regarde it may be thought leſſe needefull to write any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this latter Book, being of like matter and argument with the other. Yet in ſome reſpects, we have thought it not amiſſe, now to give thee this ſhort advertiſement, and the few obſervations following, about the contents of this latter Book alſo, eſpecially about that poynt of the diviſion made lately among us, and the articles given out therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Concerning which there was not ſuch occaſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, eyther in that Anſwer to <hi>Thomas VVhite,</hi> or in any other of our writings, to publiſh ſomewhat thereabout, as there was about the other matters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in this Book of theirs. And therefore for thy better ſtay and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the advertiſement following now given thee about theſe things: where they are more at large (though yet but briefly) ſpoken of.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen it pleaſed the Lord Ieſus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale the vvord of his truth, unto the Gentiles, by the miniſterie of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Apoſtles there aroſe up ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to vvithſtand the ſame, and to abuſe his vvitneſſes thereof. VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paul and Barnabas vvere ſent forth by the Lord to preach the Goſpel to the nations, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, the Deputie Sergius Paulus called them unto him, and deſired to heare the vvord of God; then Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſtirred up his inſtrument, Elymas, a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and a ſorcerer, vvho vvithſtood them, &amp; ſought to turne avvay the Deputie from the fayth. <hi>Act. 13.6-10.</hi> The like alſo did ſome of the Ievves at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia, vvho ſeeing the vvord of God to prevayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Gentiles (and them deſirous of further inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therein) vvere full of envie &amp; ſpake againſt thoſe things, vvhich vvere ſpoken of Paul, contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting &amp; blaſpheming. <hi>ver. 45.</hi> Like enemies did Paul again finde at Epheſus, of the Ievves. For he having ſpoken boldly in their Synagogue for the ſpace of three moonths, diſputing &amp; perſvvading the things concerning the kingdome of God: then certaine of the Ievves having their harts hardened, not onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed and beleeved not the vvord, but ſpake evill of that vvaie before the multitude. <hi>Act. 19.8.9.</hi> And manie other the like exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of men oppoſing againſt the vvord of truth, and of haters &amp; perſecuters of the profeſſors thereof might be ſhevved, both out of the Scriptures and eccleſiaſticall hiſtories.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:19231:4"/>
            <p>And as then it vvas, in the firſt opening of the light to the Gentiles, that Sathan by his Miniſters vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the preaching thereof: ſo novv ſince that the Lord in mercie hath diſcovered the man of ſinne, and cauſed his truth (obſcured by the darke miſtes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie) againe to be revealed to us in theſe laſt tymes; ſending his firſt,<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.6. &amp;c.</note> ſecond, and third Angels, to preach an everlaſting Goſpel to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that dvvell on the earth, that vvere overſpread in Apoſtaſie vvith the errors &amp; abhominations of the man of ſinne: and to teach us to vvalke in the vvaies of God; calling us from the vvorship of the beaſt, and receiving of his marke, to keepe the commandements of God, and the faith of Ieſus <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even novv alſo, I ſay, have there riſen up enemies of all ſortes, to ſtoppe this vvaie of truth, &amp; to reproch, vexe, and perſequute the vvitneſſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For to paſſe by all thoſe hard ſpeaches and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deeds that have bene ſince &amp; before the dayes of Luther againſt the Saincts and faith of Ieſus; I vvill come to our ovvne particular caſe and ſtate, vvhereof there be manie of us, that by experience can give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, vvhat hard meaſure vve have ſuſteyned for the cauſe of Chriſt: and do ſtill undergoe reproches, ſclanders, railings againſt, and the like: as it cannot be unknovven (eſpecially to our countrimen) vvhat vve have borne at the handes of ſome of them, vvho have manie times &amp; vvaies ſmitten us vvith their tongues:<note place="margin">Ier. 18.18.</note> beſides all the other troubles and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſuſteyned by us, to impriſonment, baniſhment and death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And vvhat is it for, but becauſe (according to the meaſure of grace, given us from above) vve have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated our ſelves fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch corruptions of Antichriſt, vvherein vve formerly ſtood: and doe vvalke in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19231:4"/>vvaie of the Lord revealed uuto us out of his vvord, vvitneſsing againſt all falſe vvaies and deviſes of men brought into the Church for the vvorſhip &amp; ſervice of God, our deſire and indevour being to ſtand and plead for that old and good vvaie of God, vvherein all are bound to vvalke. <hi>Ier. 6.16.</hi> For if the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt us vvere onely and ſimply for ſinne, and through an hatred that ſuch men have againſt ſinne, then vvould they firſt begin vvith them ſelves, both to look to their ovvne ſinnes and iniquities, and to take the like courſe againſt the ſinnes and tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Churches and members thereof, vvhere novv they are, or vvhere ever they ſhould be.</p>
            <p>But thus hath it pleaſed God to make us like in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring reproches and calumniations to his Saincts and people of old, vvho feeling the burden therof to be heavie and grievous, complained unto the Lord, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>How long ſhall the adverſarie reproch, ſhall the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie blaſpheme thy name for ever? Pſal. 74.10.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they utter forth their complaint, ſaying: <hi>Wee are a reproch to our neighbours, a ſcorne and deriſion to them that are round about us. Pſal. 79.4.</hi> And even this is our caſe, vvho alſo are made a reproch to our neighbours, a jeſt and a laughing ſtock to them that are round about us: having our ſoules alſo (as they had theirs) filled too full of the mocking of the vveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, and diſpitefulnes of the proud. <hi>Pſal. 44.13.</hi> and <hi>123.4,</hi> So that in reſpect hereof vve may complain vvith David, vvho ſaid, <hi>I was a reproch among all myne enemies, but ſpecially among my neighbours; and a feare to myne acquaintance, who ſeeing mee in the ſtreets fled from me.</hi> And againe, <hi>I am become a straunger unto my Brother, even an aliant unto my mothers ſonnes. I became a proverbe unto them, and they that ſitte in the gateſpake

            </p>
            <p>And although our loving Father do thus humble &amp; chaſtiſe us juſtly for our ſinnes, yet doth he alſo in mercie cover them: and gives us novv to beare theſe ſclanderous reports, of <hi>Schiſmatikes</hi> and the like, for the teſtimonie of his truth: In vvhich reſpect the Lord indeed honoureth us. For our Churches eſtate, and our conſciences do vvitneſſe vvith us and for us to God and men, that vve have not vvillingly left any truth, or any ordinance of God, that vve had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received vvith others in our apoſtate ſtanding, but are carefull to reteyne them all (vvhat in us is) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the corruptions that vvere mixed vvith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in our former corrupt receiving of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neyther have vve made diviſion and offences contrarie to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, vvhich vve have learned from the Apoſtles; but do vvalke in the auncient vvaie of the primitive Churches, keeping the ordinances, vvorſhip, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of government, preſcribed by the Apoſtles, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixture of Antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or other humane ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: And therefore unjuſtly are vve termed <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes.</hi> If it can be ſhevved othervviſe in any thing, let the vvitneſſes, the vvritings of the Apoſtles and Prophets be brought forth againſt us: and vve truſt vve ſhall through the grace of God yeeld thereunto: as vve have ben carefull hitherto to ſhevv it forth in the redreſſing of ſuch things as have ben obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us to ſvvarve any vvaie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God. Great are our tryals by men on all hands, vvhich vve ſuffer for our vvitneſſe bearing of Ieſus, vvhiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our exile &amp; other afflictions, ſome are ſpeaking bitter and ſclanderous vvords againſt us, yea and our ovvne neighbours ſpare us not, and others alſo ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

            </p>
            <p>Yet if theſe reproches &amp; hard dealings touched our ſelves onely, and did not vvith all reach to the truth vvhich vve vvitneſſe; vve could and vvould reſt patiently, vvay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting untill the Lord avenge our cauſe; &amp; vvould not once open our mouthes or ſet our pennes to paper, to vvrite in defence of our porſonall injuries: But ſeeing thus together vvith detracting of us, the truth of God comes to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and deſpiſed in this reſpect; if vve ſhould paſſe over theſe things altogether vvith ſilence, and not ſtand in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Lords cauſe, vve might be arraigned juſtly as guyltie of betraying his truth, &amp; as men aſhamed of Chriſt before men: VVe dare not therefore herein be vvanting to beare vvitneſſe to the vvord of truth, vvhen men thus labour the darkning thereof, and for the maintenance of their ovvne corruptions, do ſet them ſelves to ſpeake and vvrite againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>Of late there is come forth a pamphlet and ſclanderous book full of reproches, publiſhed by one <hi>Christopher Lawne and other his companions.</hi> In vvhich there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned ſundrie things of divers ſorts. Some touching our generall cauſe, about the Church of England: ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſinging of Pſalmes uſed among us: ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout perſonall matters, concerning divers of us &amp; others: ſome touching a diviſio made lately by divers amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g us, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Concerning our generall cauſe, although we have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten often, and manie treatiſes thereabout, vvhich remaine yet unanſvvered: yet ſeeing vve are here againe thus abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about it; and that not onely by the perſons aforeſaid, (vvhich vve might better paſſe by) but by one <hi>M. Robert Parker,</hi> vvhoſe teſtimonie is here inſerted: vve purpoſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19231:6"/>therefore (Godvvilling) to vvrite in particular about his teſtimonie; &amp;c ſo againe by this occaſion to publiſh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat more about that our generall cauſe aforeſaid: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the preſent vve have both ſome occaſions to deale in other things, and ſome reaſons to ſtaye us yet a vvhile fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> publiſhing of that, vvhich by the grace of God, vve purpoſe to doe. In the meane time, let this be noted concerning M. Parker and his teſtimonie: hovv he hath heretofore in a large booke pleaded againſt the Church of England, that by reaſon of the croſſe in Baptiſme, &amp; other Ceremonies reteyned among them, they become guiltie of the breach of all the tenne commandements, as alſo of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvith Antichriſt, &amp; ſlaverie under him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Novv vve purpoſe to trie, hovv he can on the other hand approve the ſtate of the ſame Church, as novv it ſtandeth, and as it is vvitneſſed againſt by us: &amp; hovv he can vvarrant us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vvith the ſame in that their eſtate: or vvhether it may pleaſe God by this meanes to give him &amp; others, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obſerve and regarde their halting betvveen tvvo opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, then hitherto they have done. VVe finde that for the former plea, handled in his book, he hath alledged the Scriptures ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully, as throughout the book may be ſeen: but vvhether he can ſo doe for this latter, ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of in his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie againſt us, time and further occaſion vvill mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. Yet in the meane time all may ſee, that there is not the like done againſt our cauſe, eyther in his teſtimonie publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or in the vvhole book, vvherevvith his teſtimonie is joyned: vvhich is as barren of vvarrant from the Scripture, for the eſtate of the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d called into queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as M. Parkers former book againſt it is fruitfull therein. VVhich let the Reader vvell obſerve.</p>
            <p>Touching the ſinging of Pſalmes uſed amongſt us (vvhereof the perſons aforeſaid ſpeak alſo their pleaſure in their book) vve are purpoſed ere long, if God vvill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

And ſooner alſo might vve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh both theſe and other things, then vve doe, vvere it not for the troubles, that theſe men and others have procured us, and ſtill doe.</p>
            <p>As for the perſonall matters publiſhed in the book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, although vve leave the matters concerning others to them ſelves; &amp; doe for this Church acknovvledge that indeed vve have had our tranſgreſſions and infirmities like as in the Churches of Corinth, Galatia, and others in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and at this day may be ſeen: for vvhich vve are much grieved: yet is it good &amp; needfull for the Reader here, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that ſaying, <hi>Quis erit innocens, ſi accuſare ſufficiat?

And hovv ever vve be dealt vvithall in this ſort, yet muſt vve comfort our ſelves, in the aſſurances of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and in the common and continuall lotte of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, vvalcking through good and through euill report before us.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:19231:7"/>
            <p>Novv touching theſe men and their dealings I purpoſe not in particular to ſhevve hovv ungodly, &amp; unjuſtly they have dealt againſt us: not onely contrarie to all pietie, but againſt all modeſtie, in laying ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the infirmities &amp; tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of ſome (vvhoſe repentance is knovvn even to theſe reprochers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves, as it was to the whole Church) alſo in ſhameleſſe publiſhing of ſome things never heard of in our Church, nor ſo much as knovven to the parties vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they mention; beſides their uttering of ſome things alſo verie falſe and untrue. And that ſo, as the vvriting it ſelf in the cares and judgment of the vviſe doth ſufficiently convince the Authors of aboundance of malice, &amp; argues in them vvant of grace, &amp; of the feare of God, (a juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that have vvalked haltingly before God in his Church, and have vvilfully refuſed to heare the voice of Chriſt Ieſus in the ſame) that have ſo ſpitefully &amp; ſclanderouſly vvritten againſt this Church, againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and other Officers &amp; members thereof, &amp; have thus vvith their bitter venemous toungues ſmitten them, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord doth accept, and to vvhom (I truſt) he vvill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite good for this their curſing: as David in a like caſe did comfort himſelf. <hi>2 Sam. 16.7-12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And touching our forbearing novv to anſvvere their vvriting being ſuch as it is, it may ſuffice that vve have ſhevved heretofore, concerning the like vvriting of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Whites,</hi> that vve can &amp; have anſvvered ſuch ſhameleſſe vvritings, <hi>least ſuch fooles ſhould be wiſe in their owne conceits: Prov. 26, 5.</hi> and ſo might doe by this book, for the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſclaunders therin conteyned, as vve did by that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but it ſeemes partly not ſo needefull, ſeeing the ſame things and the like are novv publiſhed by theſe, that vvere then alſo by <hi>Thomas White</hi> (vvherunto anſvver vvas given) partly not meete or good to follovv theſe vvicked men in their ungodly courſes: but to obſerve that other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19231:7"/>proverbe of Salomons, vvhich ſaith, <hi>Anſwer not a foole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his follie, least thou alſo be like him: Prov. 26.4.</hi> as alſo to leave them and their dealings to the judgement of the Lord, &amp; to the cenſure of all godly &amp; indifferent men, to judge vvhether they vvould juſtifie any amongſt them, that ſhould ſo carrie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves, as to publiſh to the vvorld, the ſlippes and ſinnes of the particular perſons of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</p>
            <p>For if men ſhould take this courſe, as theſe have done, vvhat volumes might not be vvritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the faults &amp; ſinnes of particular Churches? Is there any ſocietie or companie to be found on earth, that if any vvould make a diarie of their lives (yea even of them that are religious and godly) but there vvould be found manie things amiſſe amog the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? and yet no grace to any of ſuch a companie, (eſpecially in ſuch a ſpitefull manner) to commit ſuch perſonall ſinnes to print? Let theſe men take a like ſurvaie of ſuch ſocieties or Churches, that they are vvithall, and ſee if they can not finde as manie, yea (if they vvould not be partiall) a great manie moe vices and other manner tranſgreſſions, then vvith al their ſclanders they are able to charge this Church vvithall. And vvill not any then, judge theſe men in this their doing, to have ſhevved great malice and partialitie: and that not the ſpirit of God, but Satan (that enemie to Michael &amp; his Angels) hath ſet them on vvorke to reproch the truth it ſelf, by this their vile dealing? Or vvould them ſelves take it in good part, if vve ſhould laye open their ovvne perſonall ſinnes, vvhich vve knovve by them, both manie and great? VVhat have they then done to us, or hovv have they kept herein that rule of Chriſt, vvhich ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould doe unto you, even ſo doe ye unto them. Mat. 7.12.</hi> But being ſorie to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus adde more ſinne to their former ſinnes, for vvhich they vvere excommunicate, I vvill leave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the Lords
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19231:8"/>cenſure to vvorke upon them, if ſo it pleaſe God, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their ſoules in the daie of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>1 Cor. 5.4.5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here by this occaſion, vve vvill ſpeak a litle concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gods vvorke, about tvvo others, vvho haue hertofore vvritten againſt this poor Church, and againſt the Paſtour and members thereof, as novv theſe have done. The one vvas <hi>George Iobnſon</hi> the Paſtours brother, vvho dyed at Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: the manner of vvhoſe ſicknes and death vvas ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hither to his brother by vvriting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, by a friend of his that vvas often vvith him, both before &amp; in the time of his ſicknes: VVho vvrote hither, that he being in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, beſtovved the moſt of his time, in finiſhing the book which before he had begunne, and whereof ſome ſheets are printed; vvhich vvhen he had done, it pleaſed God to viſite him vvith ſicknes unto death. At vvhich time on his death bedde, he gave out (as he vvrote, &amp; is vvell knovvn) <hi>verie heavie &amp; great exclamations about his ſinnes by the Lord layd to his charge, calling unto God for mercie.</hi> And <hi>in this ſort</hi> (ſayth the Gentleman that vvrit the letter, &amp; vvas preſent there) <hi>he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued by the ſpace of an houre that I was with him, ſhewing great trouble in minde, yet not without comfort in the Lord, whoſe ſervant I doubt not but he dyed.</hi> The vvords ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by him, and other circumſtances mentioned in the Letter aforeſaid, vve ſpare yet to ſet dovvne: as vve vvould alſo ſtill have done the thing it ſelf, but that vve are thus continually provoked hereunto, and that vve hope it vvill be for the good of others, to ſtay them from ſuch courſes: and above all to the glorie of God, vvhich is to be obſerved and acknovvledged in all his vvorks.</p>
            <p>And vvhereas it is ſo often objected, by <hi>M. Bernard, M. Hall, M. White, Christopher Lawne and others,</hi> that the Paſtors brother vvas excommunicated among us, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19231:8"/>his father alſo, it is to be noted, that yet never a one of them hath undertaken to ſhevve the cauſes to be unjuſt, or the thing unlavvfull. Nay vvhen Mr. VVhite made it one head of his book, to except vvhat he could about the excommunications that had paſſed in this Church, and vvrote of ſundrie perſons &amp; their cauſes in particular: yet it may be obſerved, that he doth not ſo much as once offer to inſiſt upon theirs: vvhich of all others no doubt he vvould moſt of all have done, if he had thought he could have made any plea thereabout. And vvho vvill not conſider, that ſuch as vvould thus blame the excommunicating of any perſons, ſhould firſt be able and carefull to ſhevv the cauſes thereof and the proceeding againſt them, to be unjuſt? For othervviſe, if they be juſt and lavvfull, ſo as none can except thereagainſt, it is the more god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and commendable (though accompanied vvith grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tryall) vvhen neyther father nor mother, brother nor ſiſter, ſonne nor daughter are ſpared. As in the Scriptures vve read, hovv Moſes commended and God bleſſed Levi, for not knovving his ovvne father or mother, brethren or children, but obſerved the vvord of God, and did his vvill againſt them, though it vvere to the inflicting of death upon them: <hi>Deut. 33.8.9. with Exod. 32.26-29.</hi> Eyther therefore let men by the vvord of God diſprove the cauſes and proceeding in the excommunications they except againſt at any time: or els being not able ſo to doe, the more they vvrite againſt us, the more it maketh for us in deede; and ſo vvill be obſerved by them that are vviſe according to godlynes.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſeeing the parties here ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of are novv depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this life, if M. Iohnſon ſhould vvrite any thing about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by vvhich they ſhould novv be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d blame vvorthy:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19231:9"/>vvho can not perceive, that this then alſo vvould be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt him, and that men vvould not ſtick to ſaye, that novv he might ſpeak vvhat he vvould of them, vvhen they vvere not living to anſvver for themſelves; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they vvere novv dead, &amp; ſo neare unto him as they vvere, yet he vvould vvrite thus and thus of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For they that ſpare not ſo to abuſe him as novv they do, even about things publikely heard and knovven, vvhereof there are ſo manie vvitneſſes yet living: hovv vvould they much more abuſe any thing that he ſhould novv ſay or vvrite concerning them, vvhen they are gone and departed this life? They that obſerve hovv he and the reſt of us are dealt vvithall, vvill conſider theſe things. And it ſhall be good for him and us all, to poſſeſſe our ſoules vvith pacience, &amp; to vvaite on the Lord, truſting in his mercie, making our refuge in the ſhadovve of his vvings, till our cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities be overpaſt, and that it pleaſe the Lord to ſave us from the reproch of them that vvould ſvvallovve us up. For doubtles God vvill ſend forth his mercie and his truth: as he hath hitherto graciouſly delivered our ſoules from death, &amp; our feet from falling: that vve may vvalke before him in the light of the living. <hi>Pſal. 57.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other that vvrote in like ſorte, as theſe have done, vvas <hi>Thomas White</hi> ſpoken off before, vvho after his living here, and vvriting ſo ungodly as he did, returned and lived a Miniſter at London under the Prelates: vvhere vvhen he had after ſome vvhile gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a benefice in ſuch ſort as he did, the Lord ſoon ended his daies. Theſe things I thought thus briefly to mention, being (it may be) of ſome not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as they ſhould. And hovv ever the Lord ſpare ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goe on in their courſe a vvhile, yet in the end if they repent not, his hand vvill finde them out, and bring their vvaies upon their ovvn heads: as throughout the Scriptures vve may read. <hi>Pſal. 52. &amp; 55.12.13.14.15-23.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:19231:9"/>
            <p>But novv omitting to vvrite any thing more of them, that have thus dealt vvith us, &amp; leaving them to the Lord: I vvill proceede to the next and laſt ſpeciall matter, vvhich at this time I purpoſe to ſpeake of. And that is about the perſons (ſpoken of in this laſt book) vvho of late divided them ſelves from us, and have ſince that time given forth ſome exceptions and Articles of difference, both here at Amſterdam and othervvhere. Here they gave out ſome vvhich vve heard of, but never had copie of them, untill novv that theſe men have printed them, being taken (as they ſay) from the originall copie. Othervviſe alſo they have given out the like, in letters ſent into England, as vve have heard, &amp; by meanes of one there, to vvhom they ſent had certaine knovvledge thereof: vvho dealt more godly and indifferently thereabout, then any other of them, that have in ſuch ſorte ben poſſeſſed and praejudiced againſt us. And as that party dealt vvell vvith us, in acquainting us vvith thoſe things, vvhich thus covertly vvere vvritten &amp; given out againſt us: ſo did vve alſo for his better ſatiſfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vvrite unto him againe in particular thereabout. The vvhich both Articles and Anſvveres thereunto, vve haue thought good to keep them by our ſelues hitherto. But ſeeing that other the like in effect, though increaſed in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, are thus publiſhed to the vvorld, and that therein they have not as they ought, handled &amp; juſtifyed the cauſes for vvhich they ſeparated from us (vvhich vvere annexed at the end of the treatiſe upon Mat. 18.17. and ſhall alſo be againe annexed here, but haue gone about alſo to poſſeſſe the vvorld vvith other matters, then thoſe for vvhich they made their breach: and by theſe their courſes, doe impute blame unto our doctrine, as if vve mainteyned opinions contrarie to the truth, labouring thereby to ſette a more glorious ſhevv upon their popular government and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: and that thereby vve perceive, the truth is much
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19231:10"/>hindered, and vve injuried, and many by their meanes and opinions ſo deceived, that they deſpiſe the holy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, vvhich he hath ſet in his Church to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by the Elders thereof, &amp; refuſe to ſubmit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: and that not onely they vvho have thus vvritten &amp; dealt here, but others alſo in our ovvn cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, praejudiced vvith theſe matters, and ſiniſterly poſſeſſed vvith ſome of their vvritings, againſt us and our cauſe, are likevviſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and ſo have shevved it, both vvhen occaſionally ſome of us haue been vvith them there, and alſo among them ſelues, as vve hear: vve haue therefore for theſe and other the like reaſons thought it good, not to keepe theſe things any longer private by us, but for the better ſatiſfying of all, touching the things vve hold, and the clearing of our ſelves from the imputations layed upon us hereabout, and removing the ſcandall vvhich ſome have taken &amp; are like yet more to take upon the publishing of this vvriting of theirs: novv therefore to print alſo the ſaid Anſvver to their exceptions, that men may ſee, and be able the better to judge be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tvveen us &amp; them, vvhen they shall haue heard both of us ſpeak, &amp; shall have aſvvell our anſvvers as their objections to read and conſider of by the vvord of God.</p>
            <p>And though it haue thus fallen out betvveen us and our brethren, &amp; they grovven to that height, that they vvould not be perſvvaded to continevv vvith us in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion; vviſe men vvill conſider, it is but an auncient practiſe of Sathan thus to diſquiet and trouble the Church of God. In the Church at Corinth vvere contentions and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions raiſed up amongſt the brethren, ſo that ſome held of one Teacher, ſome of an other <hi>1 Cor. 1.10-12.</hi> And aftervvard vvhat contention grevve betvveene the eaſtern and vveſtern Churches about the time of keeping the feaſt of Eaſter, none can be ignorant that hath read thereabout the auncient hiſtories. Alſo vvhat fell out

            <p>Novv ſeeing the like troubles, diviſions and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have fallen out in former times in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God, and that men have their infirmities (though othervviſe being religious and fearing God) they vvhich are of a ſpirituall diſcerning, vvill not upon everie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that ariſeth amongſt the profeſſors of Chriſt, by reaſon of their vveakneſſes, and perſonall ſinnes and infirmities, open their mouthes to ſpeake evil of the vvaie of God, though ſome take pleaſure therein, vvho shall finde one daie the avenging hand of God upon them, if they repent not.</p>
            <p>And touching theſe perſons aforeſaid, that have ſo ſeparated from us, and thus offenſively vvritten, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvade my ſelf, that manie of them, are perſvvaded (though deceived by the ſubtiltie of Sathan) that they have the truth, and that they did runne at the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe extremities, being carried (as the Anabaptiſts and others alſo haue been) vvith a zeale for the truth &amp; glorie of God againſt that Antichriſtian Apoſtaſie &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vvhich formerly the Prelates &amp; miniſters of that uſurped authoritie oppreſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvithall. And for myne ovvne part, I hope that ſo manie of them as are the Lords elect, he vvill in time (by the meanes uſed for their good) give them to ſee, both their errours they ſtand in, &amp; their grievous ſinne, in ſo rashly and unjuſtly breaking off them ſelves from the Church vvhereof they ſtood members, &amp;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19231:11"/>that others by their example vvill take heed of the like hereafter.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I thus vvrite, not to excuſe evil in any, but to take avvay occaſion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that ſeek occaſion to rayſe up ſclander againſt the cauſe of God, by reaſon of theſe things thus falling out amongſt us: and that men ſhould knovve, that the vvaie of God hangeth not upon the lives of men; but is to be regarded in reſpect of the Lord the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof. Verie evill therefore doe they, that take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch diſſenſions, to blaſpheme the truth it ſelf. The erroneous vvalking of any profeſſors, ſhall not excuſe others, that imbolden themſelues thereby to ſtand in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, and ſeeke not after the truth and vvaie of God, that Chriſt hath commanded all to vvalke in.</p>
            <p>Thus having (good Reader) praefixed this ſhort adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, for thy better informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about the things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, as alſo about this my purpoſe in ſetting forth of this Anſvver to the Objections aforſaid: receiue novv the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver it ſelf, as it vvas penned by the vvriter thereof, vvith ſome additions thereunto by the ſame author, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of inlargeing and publiſhing of the ſaid Exceptions novv printed.

And if in any thing we fayle hereabout through ignorance, and want of underſtanding, we ſhall willingly receiue, and that with thanks, thy brotherly advertiſement thereof.</p>
            <p>And becauſe among other things, we are much abuſed about a particular concerning the Church of Rome, wee haue therefore hereunto annexed ſomewhat out of the writings of <hi>M.

            <p>Secondly, it muſt be remembred, that our profeſſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie hath been, and muſt be, to have the word of God for our direction in all things; by it to trie all things, to keep that vvhich is good; and to refuſe and redreſſe whatſoever is evill, or any way erring therefrom: (For which ſee <hi>the Praeface of our Confeſſion at the end of it:</hi> And in <hi>the Apologie pag. 13. &amp; 41:</hi> as alſo <hi>the Anſwer to Thomas White, pag. 36.</hi>) So as there is no weight in it to ſay, <hi>Thus we held here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; &amp; now we hold thus:</hi> unleſſe it could be ſhewed, that it is againſt the word of God, that which now is held by us. Nay ſeeing the faith of this Church, is that onely which

               <hi>that the Church is to be governed onely by thoſe lawes and Officers, that the Lord hath appointed in his word, and by none other.</hi> From vvhich how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever vve have erred in our practiſe, yet this is our aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent faith: ſo as that vvhich novv vve doe, is to reteyne our euncient fayth, &amp; to reforme our practiſe according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as vve are bound daily to grow in grace and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the fayth. And for our practiſe alſo, if vve vvould inſiſt upon it, our auncient practiſe it ſelf vvas othervviſe, then as lately of a fewe yeeres it had been: vvhich later courſe the people that are departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us vvould have had us to reteyne.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19231:19"/>Neyther ſhould they forget, hovv M.

Lev. 20.4, 5. &amp; 24.14. Numb. 5.2.3. Deut. 13.9.</hi> all vvhich doe directly carry us for this matter to the Church of Iſrael and conſtitution thereof: vvhich novv (through love of their error) they vvould not be brought unto, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and deciding of the matter betvveen us.</p>
            <p>Obſerve alſo hereabout, that the povver of receiving in and cutting off given to the Church of Iſrael, vvas by them uſed and to be performed according to order, and not any vvay to vveaken, but to ſtabliſh the Elders auctoritie. And vve muſt not be ſtraungers from the policie of Iſrael, <hi>Eph. 2.12. &amp;c.</hi> Yea this verie inſtruction in <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> is ſuch, as it accordeth vvith and hath reference unto the grounds and ordinances of God, taught of old by Moſes &amp; the Prophets: as is ſhevved in particular in the Treatiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and in the Churches agreement publiſhed there about: So as their oppoſition againſt us therein, is indeed againſt Iſrael, againſt Moſes, &amp; againſt the Prophets: And vvhether the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it be not alſo conſequently againſt the Lord and his ordinances preſcribed in his vvord, let all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent men judge. Such is their error, and ſo great is their tranſgreſſion and iniquitie.</p>
            <p>And hitherto of the firſt Objection: vvhich in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted copie, is the ſecond. VVhere furthermore obſerve, hovv vvhen they doe here quote the Scriptures alledged for proof of the 24 Article of the Confeſſion, they doe it thus, <hi>Mat. 18.17. &amp;c.</hi> vvhereas in the Confeſſion, it is thus, <hi>Pſal. 122.3. &amp;c.</hi> VVhich is to be noted in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19231:19"/>Firſt, becauſe it ſheweth, that at the ſetting downe of the Confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Scriptures of the old teſtament were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the confirmation of it, aſvvell as of the newe. Secondly, that <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> is ſo to be underſtood, as may agree vvith the other Scriptures, &amp; namely vvith <hi>Pſal. 122.3. Lev. 20.4.5. and 24.14. Numb. 5.2.3. Deut. 13, 9.</hi> vvhich Scriptures are in this article alſo alledged, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vvith that of <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> Thirdly, that it muſt be underſtood vvith agreement and proportion to the order and manner of Iſrael, vvhereof theſe ſcriptures doe directly ſpeak. Fourthly, that therefore our underſtanding of it novv, as vve doe, is (in the truth of the point it ſelf) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our auncient ſayth: and not theirs vvho vvould make us ſtraungers from Iſrael, and vvould perſvvade us that Chriſts doctrine in <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> is a nevve rule for the Churches novv, vvhich Iſrael had not. And that theſe people therefore have in deed left the ancient faith, which thing they object unto others.</p>
            <p>Moreover by the Scriptures aſoreſayd joyned together and compared vvith the eſtate of Iſrael, it doth appeare (&amp; reaſon it ſelf doth teach it) that we muſt diſtinguiſh betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſentence of excommunication, and betvveen the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof: as betvveen the ſentence of death, of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, or the like, and betvveen the execution follovving thereupon. Novv in Iſrael the Elders in cauſes of death, &amp; the Prieſts in caſe of Leproſie, had a rightfull povver to give out the ſentence of death and of leproſie and the like, according to the lavv of God, vvithout aſking the peoples conſent, yea and though it ſhould have been vvithout and againſt the conſent of the people, vvhom they call here the bodie of the Congregation. <hi>Deu. 1.16. and 17.8-12. and 24.8. with 2 Chron. 26.16-20. Levit. 13. &amp;c.</hi> And vvhen the Elders and Prieſts had ſo pronounced the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence according to the vvord of God and dutie of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19231:20"/>then vvas it for the people to performe the execution accordingly: as may be ſeen in the Scriptures aforeſaid, &amp; many other the like.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo the Elders may now by vertue &amp; dutie of their Office give out the ſentence of excomunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to the lavv of God, and the people ſhould accordingly put it in execution, by avoyding the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmunicated perſons till they repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or if any of the people can except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Elders proceeding therein, they are to be heard: as in the foreſaid Treatiſe upon Mat. 18, 17. I have vvritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heretofore. VVhere note further, hovv in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it is often mentioned (&amp; particularly in our agreement about the underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of this Scripture of <hi>Mat. 18.17.) that we ſhould alway underſtand and obſerve theſe things according as in Iſrael (in the due proportion &amp; perpetuall equitie thereof): and therefore not to abridge the brethren of their aſſent or any right that doth apperteyne unto them by the word of God: but to doe all things acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rding to the rules preſcribed therein, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here let me then aſke of this people thus divided hereabout: firſt, vvhether in Iſrael the Lord abridged the people of their right &amp; libertie any way, in that by his word the Elders and Prieſts might admoniſh ſinners, &amp; give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, and leproſie, and the like things, vvithout aſking or taking the peoples conſent thereunto. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vvhether the people have any more right and authoritie in the Churches government novv, then the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael had in thoſe dayes: Thirdly, vvhether the people of Iſrael vvere not kings &amp; prieſts, even a kingdome of prieſts, and a holie nation, aſvvel as the Chriſtian people are now: <hi>Exod. 19, 5, 6. Pſal. 149.1. &amp;c. with 1 Pet. 2.9.10. Rev. 1.6.</hi> Fourthly, vvhether the Churches power, vvhich the Lord hath given unto it, be not a miniſteriall povver onely? Fiftly, vvhether the Elders povver be not miniſteriall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lord, in and for the Church, ſo as it is the Lords
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19231:20"/>primarily, the Churches ſecondarily, and the Officers mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterially or inſtrumentally for the Lord &amp; the Church, vvhoſe Officers they are: and that therefore there is no vveight in their Objections about the Elders povver, as if it vvere not the Churches, and that vvhich perteyneth to the bodie of the Congregation: but that in deed it is the Churches, &amp; ſo to be miniſtred by the Officers vvhom the Lord hath ſet in his Church, to miniſter in his name, for the Churches uſe and benefit: and that they vvhich op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the Officers herein, doe not onely oppoſe againſt them, but even againſt the Lord, &amp; the Church, for which they vvould ſeem ſo much to plead. And finally, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Oppoſites in the Churches government, as the Anabaptiſts in the Sacraments, vvould not make us aliens from the common vvealth of Iſrael, &amp; that ſo there ſhould not be one bodie of them and us, one Lord over them and us, one ſayth of theirs and ours, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> as the Apoſtle hath taught us, <hi>Epheſ. 2.12-22. and 3, 6. and 4.4. &amp;c.</hi> VVhich how abſurd and ungodly it vvere to hold, vve vviſh they may in time vvel conſider with them ſelves, afore moe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and further evils grovve upon them, then yet are.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, let me alſo aſke, vvhy they doe not here ſpeak of themſelves, (aſvvell as of us) vvhat they pleaded to be the Church ſpoken of, <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> as namely, hovv ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taught publikly, that it is the whole Church &amp; Congregation, alledging to that end, <hi>Num. 15.33. &amp; 27.2. and 35.12.</hi> as alſo, that Chriſt in this place, ſpeaketh of the kingdome of heaven, <hi>Mat. 18.1. &amp;c.</hi> and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to underſtand it of the whole Church: How ſome alſo pleaded, that it muſt be underſtood, of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men &amp; children that can ſorrovve &amp; rejoyce vvith others: preſſing to this purpoſe, that vvhich Paul ſpeaks of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and parts thereof ſorrovving and rejoycing one vvith another, <hi>1 Cor. 12.22-26.</hi> And furthermore hovv it vvas
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19231:21"/>alſo affirmed, that in caſes of queſtion and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the greater part of the people (though vvithout &amp; againſt all the Elders and other brethren) are the bodie and the Church, there ſpoken of, yea though they be in errour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And novv in their exceptions pleading about it, they ſpeak of <hi>the whole Congregation,</hi> and of <hi>the bodie of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> in an oppoſition againſt the Elderſhip: and ſo ſeeme here to imply alſo ſuch an underſtanding thereof. Touching all which, it were long to rehearſe, eyther what reaſoning vve had, or vvhat might be ſhevved about theſe poynts. But ſome fevve things I vvill note thereabout.</p>
            <p>And firſt, if this rule befound in the book of Numbers and lavves of Iſrael, as by the doctrine &amp; allegations afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid appeareth, then is it not a nevv rule, firſt given in <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> as vvas held and urged both often and earneſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. Secondly, theſe Scriptures in the book of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſpeak of civil caſes and government: and yet vvhen vve alledge theſe or the like about the Elders, as they doe about the people, they except againſt us, as if vve miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Scriptures, and give the Elders civill authoritie: vvhich I ſuppoſe they vvill not give to the people, though they make ſuch allegations about them in this queſtion, as vve doe about the Elders.<note place="margin">Num. 15.33. &amp; 27.2. &amp; 35.12.</note> Thirdly, touching theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the like, it is certaine, that the ſinners and pleas in Iſrael vvere brought before the Congregation of Elders to be judged by them, as may appeare by theſe Scriptures them ſelves, being compared vvith <hi>Num. 36.2. Deut. 19.12.17. and 1.12.16. and 16.18. and 17.8-12. Ioſh. 20.4.5.6. 1 Sam. 2.25. 2 Chron. 19.5-11. Pſal. 82.1-6. Mat. 5.22. Lnk. 22.66. Act. 6.12. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Num. 15.33. and 27.2.</note> tvvo of the Scriptures alledged, ſpeak of the people of Iſrael vvhen they vvere in the wildernes, vvhere they vvere ſixe hundred thouſand men, beſide children, <hi>Exod. 12.37.</hi> And would they have us thinke, that this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19231:21"/>people came together to hear examine and judge the caſes of ſinne and queſtion there ſpoken of, or that the parties there mentioned were brought or came unto all that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as they vvould have the cauſes of ſinne and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be brought unto the vvhole Church and congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among us, yea and the people to be bound to come &amp; judge the brethrens cauſes, that doe fall out from time to time?</p>
            <p>And for the third Scripture ſo alledged by them,<note place="margin">Num. 35.12.</note> if it be compared vvith <hi>Deut. 19.4-12.</hi> it maketh the poynt yet more playne againſt them ſelues. For Moſes ſpeaking of one and the ſame matter in both thoſe places,<note place="margin">Num. 25.12.</note> uſeth in the one place the vvord <hi>Congregation,</hi> &amp; in the other the terme of <hi>Elders:</hi> as if he vvould himſelf tell us, that he ſpeaks of the Congregation of Elders.<note place="margin">Deut. 19.12.</note> To vvhich end alſo ſee <hi>Ioſh. 20.4.5.6.</hi> where the ſame matter is againe ſpoken of: &amp; <hi>Deut. 19.15-18.</hi> vvhere after the treating of the former matter, he giveth a generall rule for the caſes that might fal out among them. And vvhether novv vve ſhould beleeve Moſes or them, let themſelves judge.</p>
            <p>Touching the phraſe of <hi>the Kingdome of heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18.1. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Mat. 18.1. &amp;c.</hi> hovvſoever many have ben caryed thereby to think that this is a nevv rule, and perteyning onely to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Goſpel ſince Chriſt, and that the people now are otherwiſe intereſſed in the Churches government then they vvere in Iſrael of old: yet it is evident that the ſame phraſe is alſo ſpoken of the ſtate and Church of the Ievves, <hi>Mat. 22.2. &amp;c.</hi> and that therefore ſuch collections from this manner of ſpeach are not ſound.</p>
            <p>And vvhat is there here taught by Chriſt, that the Iewes ſhould not be carefull to obſerve, aſvvell as vve? Should not they be humble and harmleſſe, as litle children, and ſo enter into the kingdome of heaven? <hi>Mat. 18.1-4. with Pſal. 131.1.2. Prov. 15.33. and 16.19. and 18.12. and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19231:22"/>25.6.7. 1 Sam. 12.3.4. Pſal. 138.6.</hi> Should they not avoyd giving offiences to others: &amp; vvhen others offended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould they not deale with them, and ſhevve them their ſinne; And if they did not repent and amend, bring them to the Congregation of Elders, to be further dealt vvith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their demerit; Or if they did repent, forgive them? <hi>Mat. 18.5-22. with Lev. 19.14.16.17.18. Deut, 19.15-19. and 21.18-21. and 25.5-9. with Ruth 3.9-13. and 4.1-13. 1 Sam. 2.25. Eſa. 58.6.7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further in the ſame chapter it may be obſerved,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.23. &amp;c.</note> that Chriſt teaching hovv God requireth men to forgive one another their ſinnes (under the ſimilitude of a king taking account of his ſervants) propoundeth it by the ſame phraſe of <hi>the kingdome of heaven.</hi> And this alſo is a dutie vvhich God required of the Ievves alvvayes, aſvvell as of us novv. <hi>Lev. 19.18. Exod. 23, 4.5. Pſal. 7.4. Act. 7, 26.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the next chapter,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.13.14.</note> Chriſt ſpeaking of litle childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that vvere brought unto him, ſayth that <hi>of ſuch is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven.</hi> VVhich vvas alvvayes true of the infants and children of the Ievves, as of ours novv. But if any vvould gather hereupon, for babes and litle children (as ſome doe for the men, vvomen, &amp; greater childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upon the like maner of ſpeach) that therefore they are to have a hand in the Churches government, and that the cauſes of ſinne and queſtion falling out in the church ſhould be brought unto them (aſvvell as to the Elders) and they bound to be preſent to hear and judge all ſuch cauſes ariſing among the brethren: I ſuppoſe the people them ſelves, that hold the former opinion, and make ſuch collections to maynteyne it for the vvhole Congregation, yet vvould think it abſurd thus to reaſon about the leſſer children: although they be of the bodie of the Congregation, &amp; that of ſuch alſo is the kingdome of heaven.</p>
            <p>Againe in the next chapter ſave one,<note place="margin">Mat. 21.43.</note> Matthevv ſheweth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19231:22"/>hovv Chriſt ſayd, that <hi>the kingdome of God</hi> ſhould be taken from the Ievves, and given to (the Gentiles) a nation that ſhould bring forth the fruits thereof. <hi>Mat. 21, 43.</hi> So as then by the doctrine of Chriſt himſelf, it is one and the ſame kingdome of God, under vvhich the Ievves vvere, &amp; vve novv are. The differences about ſome vvorldly cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall and mutable things, neyther doe nor can carrie vvith them an abolition of the things ſpirituall morall and perpetuall: Neyther may vve at any hand or under any pretence ſuffer our ſelves to be made aliants from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvealth of Iſrael, as is noted before.</p>
            <p>For the other Scripture,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. chap.</note> 
               <hi>1 Cor. 12, chap.</hi> the Apoſtles purpoſe is not there to ſpeak of the caſes and pleas about ſinne, and of the maner of dealing therein (as in <hi>Mat. 18.15; 16, 17.</hi> and as our queſtion vvas among us) but of the diverſitie and inaequalitie of gifts &amp; functions given by the Lord in and to his church for the help and ſervice of all, to the building up of the myſticall bodie of Chriſt. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apoſtle ſhevveth it alſo by the ſimilitude &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the members of the naturall bodie, and of the ſeverall faculties thereof: vvhich he applyeth and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, even to the feebleſt members, and to the leaſt and youngeſt children of the Church that are but newly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>1 Cor. 12.13-22. &amp;c.</hi> to vvhom yet he appointeth not the caſes of ſinne and pleas of the other members of the church to be brought for judgement &amp; cenſure, as theſe men hereupon vvould inferre, and as the matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is about <hi>Mat. 18, 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the things there ſpoken of the bodie, and of the parts thereof, might likevviſe of old be applyed to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael according to their eſtate; and they vvere then bound accordingly to vvalke, as members of one and the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, affording all help ſervice and comfort they could one unto another. Yet this might not then, nor may not now,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19231:23"/>hinder nor pervert the ordinance of God about the Elders hearing and judging the cauſes of their brethren, &amp; cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them according to their demerit: but in deede it doth much more ſtrongly eſtabliſh it, inaſmuch as the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are by the Lord ſet in the Church for that uſe, and ſo for the benefit of the whole: as alſo, that all the members have not gifts fit for examining of perſons and deciding of caſes and queſtions that doe fall out, and yet notvvithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are members in the bodie, and have othervviſe their good uſe, being fitly imployed, and muſt be holpen of the reſt as their need is, and be partakers of the gifts beſtovved upon others, for their good and comfort.</p>
            <p>And yet further, this Scripture is more direct againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in that it ſheweth how in the Church ſome have a more chief place then others, as the head, &amp; eyes, &amp; hands in the bodie: &amp; are therefore to be reſpected &amp; imployed according to their gifts and place, vvherein God hath ſet them, <hi>1 Cor. 12.14.—28.</hi> VVhich is litle regarded of them, vvho in caſes of queſtion and controverſie (vvhere there is greateſt need of moſt knovvledge and vviſedome) vvill then look vvhere the greateſt number of the people is (though they may be of the moſt ſimple) and vvill have them to be the Church, and to haue the Churches povver and authoritie to give the ſentence (yea albeit that all the Elders &amp; other brethren of better judgment, but fevver in number, be againſt them): as if the multitude ſhould ſtill be follovved, &amp; that there vvere no difference or inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of gifts, of Office, or other reſpect at all to be had VVhich how far it is from the intendement of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alledged by themſelues, let all that underſtand accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſobrietie judge.</p>
            <p>And let theſe men if they vvill not be taught otherwiſe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare vvith it, rom. 12. 3-8.</note> yet learne of their ovvne bodies, from vvhich the Apoſtle borrovveth his ſimilitude here: and there they ſhall ſee,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19231:23"/>that all the members of the bodie are not given or uſed for counſel and determination in the things that concerne it (though yet they have their other profitable uſe): where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is, that vvhen ſome part of the bodie is hurt, the hand is not uſed or ſought unto to ſee withall, nor the foot to heare, neyther doth the head take them to conſult and determine vvhat to doe there about: but vvhen the head it ſelf hath conſidered &amp; determined (according to the gift &amp; dutie thereof) then it uſeth the help of the hand or foot or any or all the members, according as there is need and occaſion. And thus have all the members their good uſe &amp; ſervice in the bodie, being rightly uſed &amp; applyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. But ſhould novv hereupon the hands or feet ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not ſought unto and employed to ſee hear &amp; determine, as the eye, eare, and head are: that therefore they looſe their right, and are not uſed or regarded as the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the bodie ſhould? Yet after ſuch a maner plead the people aforeſaid, that they are vvronged &amp; looſe their right and libertie, if vvhen matters of ſinne and queſtion ariſe between brethren of the church, they be not ſought unto, and bound to come together to hear and determine the caſes, to examine and cenſure the perſons ſo dealt vvithall.</p>
            <p>Nay though the Elders ſitte publickly to hear and judge ſuch cauſes, and that it be left free for any of the people to come that vvil: yet they thinke they have injurie, unles that they be called upon and bound to come together; and that they alſo make inquiſition and cenſure the cauſes and perſons dealt vvithall; &amp; that the greater number of their voyces (though vvithout and againſt all the Elders) be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Churches ſentence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVhich in deed, what is it els but as if eyther the whole bodie ſhould become one member, an eye, an eare, an head, or the like: or as if the foot ſhould ſay, Becauſe I am not the hand, I am not of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19231:24"/>bodie: or as if the hand ſhould ſay, Becauſe I am not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as the eye, eare, or head, therefore I loſe my right, and am not uſed or eſteemed in the bodie as I ought to be? Yea vvhat is it els, but to bring them ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bondage (and in deed to bring an Antichriſtian ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude on the people in the Church) vvhen it being left free unto them to come or not to come, yet that ſhall not ſuffice, unles they be bound thereunto, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,</p>
            <p>And ſo it ſhall not be ynough, that the Elders by their Office are bound unto it,<note place="margin">Rom. 12, 7, 8. 1 Theſ. 5.12.13. 1 Tim. 5.17.18.</note> and ought to have mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for the doing of it, and of the other duties of their Office: but the men muſt (vvithout any allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for it) leave their trades and callings, the vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men their houſes and ſamilies, the children their ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and employment, the ſervants their vvork and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<note place="margin">As may come to paſſe in great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And many moe things might be noted about this and the other Scriptures ſpoken of: but theſe few obſervations may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Yet afore I proceed, let me by this occaſion note tvvo things more hereabout in generall. The one, that as it often cometh to paſſe vvith heretiks, ſchiſmatiks &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians, that the verie Scriptures alledged by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being ſearched and duly vveighed, they are fit &amp; forceable againſt themſelues: ſo it is fallen out vvith theſe men in this caſe: as may appeare by that vvhich hath ben ſayd touching the Scriptures thus alledged by them. The other is a thing, vvhich M. Ainſvv. hath vvel obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19231:24"/>Idolatrie, <hi>that it is a ſinne which cleaveth fast to all fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arrowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Idol. ch. 2 p. 23. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>ſo as the beſt in the world doe eaſily fall into it, doe take pleaſure in it, and are hardly drawen from it:</hi> An example vvhereof may be ſeen in the people aforeſaid, vvho being caryed vvith the love of their errour about the matter ſpoken of, vvould chuſe bondage afore libertie (yea and a bondage accompanyed vvith many other evils enſuing upon men vvomen and children) rather then they vvould be dravven from the errour and Idol ſet up in their heart. But I hope their children (if not themſelves) vvill in time grovv vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, hovv ever in other things it be too common, that the children remember their fathers altars and Idols, as the Prophet Ieremiah ſaid of the people in his dayes. <hi>Ier. 17.2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me alſo about the matters themſelves concerning the greater part of the people, the vvhole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or bodie thereof; the men, vvomen, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of yeares; pleaded to be the Church ſpoken of, <hi>Mat. 18, 17.</hi> deſire to knovv by vvhat Scriptures they vvill novv manifeſt and confirme it to ſuch as are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe mynded:<note place="margin">If they ſpeak of 1 Cor. 5, chap.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19231:25"/>examine rebuke and admoniſh their huſbands, parents, &amp; maſters, being there dealt vvithall for ſinne: ſeeing the Church is told; and the vvomen and children are of the Church; and they that are of the Church there ſpoken of, may examine &amp; admoniſh, &amp; are to be heard &amp; obeyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neyther let them thinke much, that I propound ſuch queſtipns, or that I ſpeak thus about vvomen and children <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For they knovv, that ſuch aſſertions and pleading vve have had from them, and that ſuch opinions are among them. And vve knovv, that if they anſvver directly to the things here and before propounded, the truth vvill better appear, and the controverſie be ſooner ended between us: And what they hold &amp; mainteyn concerning theſe things, is needefull for us ſtill to inſiſt upon, ſeeing that about the underſtanding of this Scripture of <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> they have ſo dealt and left us as they have done.</p>
            <p>Other things I vvill omit, that might here alſo have their place and uſe: noting this onely, that it is a ſtraunge &amp; extraordinarie caſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a controverſie ſhould ſo ſtand, as all the Elders ſhould be one vvay, &amp; all the people ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.

But vvhat is this to the ordinarie maner of government in the Church, vvhereof the queſtion vvas among us, &amp; vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about it vvas particularly mentioned at the beginning, that our reaſoning ſhould be?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, vvhat vveight is there in this exception of theirs againſt our underſtanding of <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> more then might be againſt Iſrael of old, vvho could underſtand ſuch ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Congregation of Elders, vvithout impeaching any libertie of the people or falling into any errour againſt the truth? But I have ſpoken hereof before: and of this matter, more largely then I purpoſed: though yet not ſo largely as I might, conſidering the point it ſelf, and hovv
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19231:25"/>they have caryed themſelves thereabout. Novv I vvill come to the next Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> For the ſecond, vvhich concerneth excommunication by a people without officers, I have in the foreſaid Treatiſe vvritten particularly thereabout:<note place="margin">Treat. on Mat. 18.17.</note> vvhere alſo I have treated purpoſely and largely of the place of the Apologie, vvhich they have here alledged: ſo as that ſhould firſt have ben anſvvered, afore they had thus dealt as they have done; eſpecially, ſeeing that there I deſired anſvver &amp; confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that opinion, vvriting in this ſort about it, <hi>Where finde we in the Scriptures, that God hath thus laid upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without Officers to excommunicate? Where is the precept for it? Which be the examples of it? Or what are the grounds requiring and bearing it out?</hi> In the ſame place alſo I noted, that <hi>in the Scriptures we may obſerve not onely ſundry exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, ſhewing how it hath ben done by the Lord himſelf, and by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Officers: but alſo divers ordinances &amp; grounds di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and warranting us to doe likewiſe.</hi> The particulars vvhereof ſee in that Treatiſe; vvith divers other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and reaſons thereabout. VVhich might have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them eyther to anſvver us, or at leaſt (as there is noted) to conſider vvith themſelves <hi>how the Churches excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation can be adminiſtred by any but ſuch as are the Lords and the Churches Officers and Overſeers: and how people without Officers can chalendge to themſelves the miniſtration of this, any more then of the Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides, you may perce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ive both by our churches e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and by particular note ſet dovvn in the ſaid Treatiſe, that our controverſie vvas <hi>about a Church eſtabliſhed with Officers:</hi> and that it vvas before our parting agreed among us, <hi>to leave the things concerning people without Officers to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration.</hi> To vvhich alſo I do ſtill referre it. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where he ſayth here, <hi>that our doctrine overthrowes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19231:26"/>of our Church, which was gathered and constituted by Chriſtians without Officers, receiving in the repentant, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out the diſobedient, &amp;c.</hi> I vvill hereupon note a fevve things briefly, to ſhevve the errour and vveaknes of their exception herein.</p>
            <p>And firſt (omitting vvhat is ſayd before) it vvere vvorth the knovving, by vvhom (or by vvhat Church) the firſt man or firſt tvvo men of this Church (whereof they ſpeak) vvere received in, and by what povver. Secondly, it is knovven and not to be forgotten,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.4.5 1 Cor. 10.1, 2. and 12, 13. Act. 2.41.42.</note> that by our baptiſme, as alſo by accord in the truth, vve are bound to communion, in any thing lavvfull (as God giveth occaſion &amp; opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie thereunto): vvhich thing vvas heretofore ſhewed unto them: though yet they have not learned it as they ſhould. Thirdly, it is alſo playne and uudenyable, that to chuſe or give voyces in election, is not a part of governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a dutie peculiar to the governours of the Church, but an intereſt, povver, right, and libertie, that the ſaincts and people out of Office have and ſhould uſe in elections, not onely at firſt, when they have no Officers, but alvvayes after in other elections alſo, even vvhen they have Officers over them. Laſtly, ſeeing our doctrine overthrovveth not the conſtitution of the church of Iſrael afore Chriſt, nor of the primitive Churches after Chriſt, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore overthrovv the conſtitution of our Church, or of any other, that is accordingly built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles &amp; Prophets, Ieſus Chriſt himſelf being the head corner ſtone. <hi>Epheſs. 2, 19, 20.</hi> By all vvhich you may ſee, hovv vayne &amp; frivolous this their exception is. To which may be referred <hi>the firſt, ſixt, and ſeventh of the Objections</hi> in the printed copie. And ſo touching them, obſerve the things ſpoken of here, and in the foreſaid Treatiſe upon <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:19231:26"/>
            <p>For the third, it being of much like nature vvith the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond before,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> the ſame anſvver that is there given may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for it. Yet thus much I vvill acquaint you vvith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that the like thing being objected here againſt me, and vvritten of unto us from the church at Leyden, I gave this anſvver unto it: <hi>viz, that the Church may excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any Officer deſerving it, as well as any other member.</hi> Alſo <hi>that if all the Officers doe joyntly tranſgreſſe and ſo perſist, then the Church which did chuſe them, may alſo depoſe and refuſe them for beeing their Officers any longer, &amp; may ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from them. But that the people may excommunicate all their Officers or whole Elderſhip together, I deſired to ſee it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and warranted from the word of God.</hi> This vvas then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvered, &amp; ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence in a generall letter to the church at Leyden: as is knovven unto them, and vvas by Mr. Ainſw. himſelf alſo ſubſcribed at that time, for my anſvver hereunto: hovvſoever novv they ſpeake not of it. So far as chuſing reacheth (which being not an action of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be done by people out of office) ſo far alſo may the refuſing goe. And vvhatſoever (in extraordinarie ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) is attempted further, muſt be approved by the vvord of God, that ſo it may be admitted.</p>
            <p>And novv for the exception it ſelf, (vvhich is here the third, but in the printed copie is <hi>the firſt</hi>): note theſe things moreover concerning it: that the particulars of the 23 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Confeſſion here alledged, being found true in the Churches of Iſrael before Chriſt, and of the Gentiles ſince Chriſt: the exception made hereabout can not be of vvaight againſt this or any other Church eſtabliſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vvord of God, as thoſe vvere, but muſt be alſo againſt thoſe churches vvithall. For which ſee &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Scriptures alledged in the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. And obſerve here alſo, whether it can be ſhewed by thoſe or any other Scriptures, that any in Iſrael
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19231:27"/>or in the primitive Churches did ordeyne Officers, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or excomunicate eyther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or any vvicked perſons deſerving it, but ſuch as vvere Governours and Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Which ſcripture vve have indeed thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note>If any inſiſt upon <hi>Numb. 8.9.10.</hi> which of all other places is the likeſt, or onely like to be objected, becauſe there it is ſayd, <hi>the children of Iſrael ſhall put their hands upon the Levites:</hi> then note alſo further, that by this phraſe of ſpeach of <hi>the children of Iſrael,</hi> and other ſuch ſpeaches of <hi>the men of Iſrael, the tribes of Iſrael</hi> (and the like in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures) are the Elders of Iſrael often meant &amp; underſtood. As for example, in another the like caſe, they vvhich are called the Elders of Iſrael, <hi>Lev. 9.1.</hi> are in the ſame chapter called the children of Iſrael, <hi>Lev. 9.3.</hi> where the Septuagint have in both places alike, <hi>the Senate</hi> or <hi>Elderſhip of Iſrael.</hi> As alſo <hi>Ioſh. 7.23.</hi> where the Hebrevv hath <hi>the children of Iſrael,</hi> the Greek tranſlation hath <hi>the Elders of Iſrael.</hi> And verie reaſon it ſelf teacheth ſo to underſtand it. For othervviſe hovv ſhould ſo many hundred thouſand of Iſrael, as then vvere of the people, eyther at once heare or doe the things there ſpoken of? And if it be ſayd, ſome did it for the reſt of Iſrael, then I aſke, firſt, vvho thoſe ſome vvere, but the Elders, vvhom Iſrael novv had. <hi>Exo. 3.16. and 4.29. Lev. 9.1. &amp;c.</hi> and ſecondly, under vvhom they did it, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lord, vvho ſet them over the people to miniſter &amp; governe in his ſtead. <hi>Exod. 20, 12.

            </p>
            <p>So likevviſe they vvhich are called the men of Iſrael, <hi>Ioſ. 9, 6, 7, 14.</hi> are in the ſame chapter called the Princes of the Congregation, <hi>Ioſ. 9, 15, 18, 19, 21.</hi> And they vvhich are called the tribes of Iſrael, <hi>2 Sam. 7.7.</hi> are othervvhere cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Iudges of Iſrael, <hi>1 Chron. 17.6.</hi> In like maner, that vvhich is ſometimes ſaid to be done by <hi>the people, Exod. 20.18, 19. 1 Sam. 8.7, 10, 19, 21.</hi> is othervvhere ſaid to be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19231:27"/>done by the Elders <hi>Deut. 5.23. 1 Sam. 8, 4.</hi> In vvhich places &amp; actions common reaſon alſo teacheth ſo to underſtand the ſpeaches, as vvas ſhevved before. And in like ſort may be obſerved, hovv the vvord <hi>Church or Congregation</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times uſed for the Aſſemblie or Congregation of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>Num. 35, 12, 24, 25, 29. with Deut. 19, 11.13.16.17. and 31.28.30. Ioſh. 20.4.5.6. Pſal. 82.1. 1 Chron. 29.1.6. with 28.1. &amp;c.</hi> as is noted in the other Treatiſe on <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> And many ſuch Synechdochicall ſpeaches (vvhere the name of the vvhole is given to a part) may be obſerved in the Scriptures.

            <p>And thus much I thought to vvrite further hereabout: And this alſo, that they ſhould better obſerve the clauſes particularly expreſſed in the article ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Conf. art. 23.</note> as namely that the electing and ordeyning of the Officers is to be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules in Gods word preſcribed,</hi> that depoſition likevviſe is to be <hi>by due order,</hi> and that the cutting off by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication muſt be done <hi>orderly.</hi> VVhich clauſes as they bynde us to ſhew by the Scriptures, that the people not being in office may chuſe their Officers, as is proved both there, and in the Apologie heere cited, <hi>pag. 46.47.</hi> ſo doe they alſo binde theſe perſons thus making exception, to ſhevv out of the vvord of God, like rules, practiſe, or vvarrant, of ordination, depoſition, and excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, miniſtred and performed by p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> For the fourth, it is of like nature vvith the ſecond and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19231:28"/>third herebefore: vvhere therefore ſee the anſvvers. And if they vvould here imply a particular matter concerning one of our Miniſters, about impoſition of hands: that is a point alſo left to further conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among us: beſide that it fell out ſince their departing from us: and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynes not to the plea about their diviſion, vvhich vvas made before. Yet notvvithſtanding the anſvver vvhich follovves here to their fift and next exception, will both give ſome light to the poynt it ſelf, and ſhew good reaſon of the needfull diſcuſſing thereof: which you ſhall doe well therefore to conſider of as follovveth.</p>
            <p>But firſt (by occaſion of that which is printed) I will here annexe a litle more. For now they doe in particular expreſſe this matter, concerning one that was miniſter in the Church of England, and is ſince choſen Teacher of this Church, and received among us, vvithout any nevve impoſition of hands. So novv refer hither to this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>the third and fift</hi> in the copie that is printed. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which, let me firſt ſignify that our teſtimonie <hi>againſt the Antichristian hierarchie of the man of ſinne,</hi> treated of in the Confeſſion, is not by us reverſed or vveakned any way, but novv is rather more ſound and ſtronger alſo, then it vvas hitherto, inaſmuch as it is more firmely grounded, not onely againſt the apoſtaſie of Antichriſt, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the errours &amp; confuſion of the Anabaptiſts: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about we have ben encumbred, not a litle.</p>
            <p>For the Anabaptiſts holding that Antichriſt had utterly deſtroyed all Gods ordinances, ſo that there vvas not ſo much as true Baptiſme r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eyned and had among them, thereupon they began to baptiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves againe. VVhoſe errours vvhiles vve confuted (as by our books publiſhed thereabout may appeare): and vvhiles ſome of them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that vve ſhould no more reteyne the Baptiſme, then the miniſterie there received: vve had thereuppon juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19231:28"/>given us to conſider thereof. And ſo vveighing vvith our ſelves, that one mayne and ſpeciall reaſon againſt rebaptization is, becauſe Baptiſme is an ordinance of God, vvhich vvas had in the Church of Rome, before ſhe fell into apoſtaſie, and hath been there continewed ever ſince the Apoſtles tymes (hovvever it be commingled among them vvith many corruptions &amp; inventions of their own) vve began to conſider, vvhether the like might not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and ſayd concerning <hi>Impoſition of hands,</hi> that it vvas had from the Apoſtles in the Church of Rome before her apoſtaſie, &amp; is there continued to this daye; though mixed vvith many pollutions and deviſes of their ovvne.</p>
            <p>And entring into conſideration thereof, vve obſerved theſe things among other about it.
<list>
                  <item>1. That <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> is of God, and not an invention of man, not a poſt or threſhold firſt brought by Antichriſt into the Temple of God, but had therein afore Antichriſt ſate there.</item>
                  <item>2. That <hi>baptiſme and impoſition of hands</hi> are joyned together, among the principles of the foundation ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, <hi>Heb. 6, 2.</hi> which vve thought therefore ſhould in this behalf be vvell regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</item>
                  <item>3. That impoſition of hands is in the Church of Rome ſtill given to the Office of miniſterie, &amp; in the name of the Lord: as they doe alſo ſtill adminiſter baptiſme.</item>
                  <item>4. That vve found not eyther precept, example or ground in the Scripture, binding us to the repetition thereof.</item>
                  <item>5. That the Prieſts &amp; Levites in Iſrael becoming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, vvhen aftervvard they vvere cleanſed, reteyned ſtill their places of being Prieſts and Levites: And that the children of the Prieſts and Levites ſucceding after them, did miniſter vvithout a nevv anoynting or nevv impoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hands: Yea that in the caſe of Idolatrie, the Levites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting kept their function, &amp; the Prieſts alſo, being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debarred from the altar, but ſtill remayning Prieſts, both doing ſuch duties and enjoying ſuch benefits thereof, as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19231:29"/>the other Iſraelites might not, no nor the Levites, but in caſes of neceſſitie.</item>
               </list>
               <hi>Levit. 22.1-9. and Ezech. 44.10-14. 2 King. 23.9. with Lev. 21. and 24, 9. Mat. 12, 4.6.</hi> That in the Scriptures vvefinde, how ſome Officers vvere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vvith it, &amp; ſome vvithout it. As about the Levites may be obſerved: and about the Apoſtles alſo, that Paul and Barnabas had impoſition of hands, vvhich we read not that the other Apoſtles had. <hi>Act. 13, 1, 2, 3.7.</hi> That ſome Churches hold it not of neceſſitie to be had: That the Church of Scotland (as we heare) doth not uſe it at all, but in ſtead thereof give the right hand of fellovvſhip: That the firſt miniſters and officers of the Dutch and French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches had no impoſition of hands; becauſe at their firſt comming into order, they had no Elders to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hands: That the ruling Elders and Deacons at this daye have no impoſition of hands among them, as vve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: That neyther the apoſtate nor the reformed Churches repeat it to the miniſters, vvhen they goe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one Congregation to another among them. 8. And it may alſo be obſerved, that thus vve ſhevv the keeping of communion vvith all other Chriſtians &amp; Churches, what in us is: as vve doe alſo by reteyning our baptiſme, and any other truths &amp; ordinances of God had among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which ſtill vve keep, purging them onely from the corruptions wherewith they are defiled among them.</p>
            <p>Novv vvhen upon our occaſions, divers things herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout vvere obſerved among us, vve thought it beſt to ſtay and conſider further thereof; knovving that if vve finde it to be ſuch as ought to be done, vve can doe it at any tyme: or if it be othervviſe, that then this courſe vvhich vve took is the beſt. Other reaſons vve conſidered alſo on the other hand, vvhich I need not here mention. But ſeeing vve found that it was even fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles times in the church of Rome long before ſhe became apoſtate, as baptiſme
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19231:29"/>vvas; and that the repeating of it among us, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the having of it there, is a meanes to ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Anabaptiſts in their errours; and obſerving vvithall ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations about it, as are here before related, we ſtayed our ſelves: and reſted in this, that the Church did chuſe him into office; and that vve did by prayer commend him unto God for his grace and aſſiſtance in the miniſtration thereof: VVhich vve did vvithout impoſition of hands at that tyme: as both our ſelves had before done, at our firſt growing into order; and as the French and Dutch Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches alſo did, when they firſt began reformation among them. VVhereabout if any ſounder and better courſe be ſhewed hereafter at any tyme, we can then proceed further, as there ſhal be cauſe.</p>
            <p>In the meane tyme, let it here be obſerved, hovv theſe that thus object, and their partakers, can (all of them) hold that the people having no office may excommunicate; and (ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) that they may alſo miniſter the Sacraments: and yet can except againſt ſuch as are in office, if they doe but make queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a ceremonie or any thing thereabout.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, let themſelves conſider, hovv the Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts object againſt us, that vve receive ſuch for members of our Church, as were baptized by the Prelates and Prieſts in apoſtate Churches: ſo as becauſe of it vve baptiſe them not againe, vvhen at the ſame tyme vve baptiſe others that vvere never baptized before: And alſo, that the leaving &amp; repenting of all the corruptions and apoſtaſie among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvill not ſatiſfy the Anabaptiſts, unles vve leave alſo the baptiſme it ſelf, and hold vvith them that there is not ſo much as one poſt or threſhold of Gods remayning in the apoſtate Church; as ſome alſo of theſe that thus except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, have not ſtuck to affirme.</p>
            <p>They that are vviſe and unpartiall, vvill carefully conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and regard theſe things, though theſe men them ſelves
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19231:30"/>cannot yet be brought ſo to doe. And novv I vvil proceed to the next objection.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> For the fift, vvith which <hi>the fourth and eight</hi> in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted copie doe agree, it vvas in deed ſayd, that the baptiſme of the Church of Rome is true baptiſme. And ſo it is, as the circumciſion in Iſraels apoſtaſie vvas true circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not to be repeated agayne. And if it be not a true baptiſme, it is a falſe baptiſme: And falſe baptiſme is not Gods baptiſme, nor Gods ordinance. For God is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of truth, not of falſhood.</p>
            <p>Moreover a true baptiſme are vve bound to have, when vve have the meanes to attayne it. Els the neglect thereof is ſinne. VVherefore they that hold it not to be true ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, muſt become Anabaptiſts, and be rebaptized. VVhich thing let them vvell look unto.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing (in the printed copie) they ſaye, <hi>they doe ſtill denye it to be true baptiſme,</hi> I vvill here therefore inſiſt upon it ſomevvhat more. And firſt, it muſt be remembred, that vvhen I ſayd, the Baptiſme of the Church of Rome is true baptiſme, they did not onely deny it ſo to be (vvhich alone they ſpeak of here) but affirmed it alſo to be an Idol: vvhereof here they ſpeak not at all. Note alſo, that our ſpeach vvas and is, of the outvvard baptiſme in the Church not of the invvard baptiſme of the holy Ghoſt, which is &amp; may be eyther vvith or vvithout the outvvard baptiſme; &amp; wherof none vvill offer to ſay, that it is not true baptiſme, or that it is an Idol, as vvas ſayd of the other.</p>
            <p>Novv therefore upon their opinions and aſſertions, I reaſon further thus: If the Baptiſme had in the Church of Rome, be not true baptiſme, then it is not the Lords ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, ordeyned by him in his Church: And if it be not that baptiſme of the Lords, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they which have no other but it, ſhould not in that eſtate eate the Lords ſupper, but

For as in Iſrael none might eat of the Lords paſſeover, that had not the Lords circumciſion; ſo novv may none eat the Lords ſupper, that have not the Lords baptiſme. <hi>Exod. 12, 48. Act. 2, 41, 42. 1 Cor. 10, 1-4. with Act. 18.8. and 1 Cor. 11.26.</hi> And ſo by this doctrine &amp; opinion of theirs, as often as they come to the Lords table in that eſtate, they pollute and prophane it, and eate and drinke judgment to themſelves: and therefore had need betymes to look unto it, and to examine and judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hereabout, leaſt they be judged of the Lord. <hi>1 Cor. 11.28. &amp;.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agayne, there is but one baptiſme, as there is but one bodie, one ſpirit, one hope of our calling, one fayth, one God and Father of all, <hi>&amp;c. Epheſ. 4.4.5.6. 1 Cor. 12.13.</hi> Novv the baptiſme had in the Church of Rome, eyther is that one baptiſme, or is not it. If it be that one, then it is true baptiſme, vvithout all queſtion: If it be not, then they which have no other but it, have not that one ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of by the Apoſtle in the Scriptures aforeſaid: and therefore muſt get it, not onely afore they may come to the Lords table, as is aforeſaid, but alſo that they may have the comfort of this one baptiſme, &amp; the true outward ſeale of Gods covenant, to confirme unto them that they are baptized into that one bodie; partakers of that one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; heyres of that one hope of eternall life; under that one Lord, in that one fayth, the children of that one God and father of all, vvhich is above all, and through all, and in us all. Othervviſe, ſo long as they neglect or deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereof, it vvill follovv upon them by their ovvne opinion and aſſertion (vvhich they ſay <hi>they doe ſtill hold</hi>) that they ſtand in great ſinne, neglecting or contemning to have the true baptiſme, inſtituted by the Lord, &amp; that they deprive themſelves of great comfort, and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19231:31"/>on of their fayth, about the particulars aforeſayd, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the bodie and ſpirite of the Lord, the fayth and hope of the children of God even our Father in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the baptiſme had in apoſtate Churches, eyther is a ſeale of the covenant of God, or not. If it be a ſeale of the Lords covenant, then ſure it is true baptiſme. If it be not, then ſee vvhat great things vvill follovv there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: As firſt, that they vvhich have no other baptiſme but it, have not the outvvard baptiſme that ſealeth unto them the covenant of God: and therefore muſt vvith the Anabaptiſts gette another, that they may be aſſured they have the ſeale of Gods covenant of grace and ſalvation: Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, that there neyther have ben, nor ſhall be in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon any of Gods people under his covenant; which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that vvhich is vvritten, <hi>Revel. 18, 4.</hi> vvhere the Lord ſhevveth that he hath his people, vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the words of his covenant he calleth thence, ſaying <hi>Come out of her, my people, &amp;c.</hi> And if theſe men vvill ſay, that themſelves are not of ſuch people there ſpoken unto, then let them tell us vvhen and hovv they came under the covenant of God, and let them alſo ſhevv it vvithout ſtabliſhing their owne righteouſnes of vvorks thereby: Thirdly, that the baptiſme novv had in apoſtate Churches is not anſvverable to the circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had in the apoſtaſie of Iſrael: For that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion (though had in apoſtaſie) vvas true circumciſion, &amp; a ſeale of the Lords covenant, to his people; and therefore needed not to be renounced or repeated. But the baptiſme novv had in the apoſtaſie of the Church of Rome, they ſay is not true baptiſme, and ſo not a ſeale of the Lords cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to his people novv, as the other vvas then; therefore muſt be renounced, and another that is true obteyned. And thus agayne, in this they make themſelves (&amp; would make us) ſtraugers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the policie of Iſrael; as in the poynt of government alſo vvas obſerved before.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:19231:31"/>
            <p>Neyther will it novv help them to alledge thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or the like, as vve have produced heretofore againſt the Anabaptiſts, to approve the reteyning of our baptiſme had in apoſtaſie, vvithout renunciation or repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: as namely, <hi>2 Chron. 30. chap, compared with Exod. 12, 48, 49. Gen. 17, 10-13. Lev. 26.14-44.45, 46. Deut. 4.25-31.2 King. 9, 6. and 13, 23. Pſal. 78.9-38. and 89.30-34. Ezech. 16, 44-63. and 43.7-9.2 Theſ. 2, 3-8. Rom. 11, 2-5. and 15.4. &amp;c.</hi> For novv it vvill be anſvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, that in Iſraels apoſtaſie they kept circumciſion which needed not to be repeated, ſeeing it vvas true, and ſealed Gods covenant unto them: but that theſe cannot ſo plead for the baptiſme had in the apoſtaſie of Rome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe themſelves ſay, the baptiſme of the church of Rome is not true baptiſme; and ſo not the ſeale of Gods cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them vvhich have no other but it.

            <p>Finally, if the baptiſme had in the Church of Rome be not true baptiſme, then (as they alſo ſayd) <hi>it is an idol;</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſhevv and image of that vvhich it is not in truth and ſubſtance.

               <note place="margin">Pag. 13. &amp; 14.</note>

            <p>A great ſinne it vvas that they fell into, if there had ben no other but it, that vvithout juſt cauſe they brake avvay &amp; divided themſelves from the Church vvhereof they vvere: but ſeeing that therevvith they have alſo other very erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinions, and the ſinfull uſurpation of all the holy things of God uſed among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvhat an heavy eſtate doe they ſtand in, and hovv greatly doth it import them, to conſider their vvaies in their heart, and to turne their feet unto the teſtimonies of the Lord? Othervviſe let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that which the Apoſtle wrote to the Corinthians, <hi>Doe we provoke the Lord to ielouſie? are we stronger then he? 1 Cor. 10.22.</hi> And thus much I thought here by this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to vvrite about the baptiſme of the Church of Rome: novv I vvill come to ſpeak of the Church it ſelf.</p>
            <p>As touching the Church of Rome, there being alſo at that tyme ſpeach about it to be the Church of God, I did in deede alledge the ſaying of the Apoſtle, that Antichriſt ſhould <hi>ſit in the Temple of God;</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſely tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <hi>2 Theſ. 2.4.</hi> And by the Temple of God, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19231:32"/>the Church of God, it vvill follow, that Antichriſt ſhould ſit in the Church of God: and is there to be ſought and found: and not among the Ievves, Turks, Pagans, or the like, as the Papiſts &amp; others vvould perſvvade us: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Antichriſt takes avvay wholy the Church of God, and everie truth and ordinance of the Lord, as Anabaptiſts, and ſuch as are herein Anabaptiſtically inclined, would beare us in hand.</p>
            <p>Obſerve alſo here agayne, that vvhich is ſayd, <hi>Rev. 18, 4. Goe out of her my people, and partake not in her ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> vvhere thoſe vvords, <hi>my people,</hi> imply the covenant of God continued among them. For thus is the covenant taught and ſet dovvne unto us in the Scripture, <hi>I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people.</hi> And ſo is Iſrael often called <hi>the Lords people,</hi> &amp; is thus ſpoken of in the time of their apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, by the Prophets: <hi>2 King. 9, 6. &amp; 13.23. 2 Chron. 30, 6-9. Hoſ. 4, 6, 12. and 5.4. and 14.2. Amos, 7.15. and 8.2. &amp;c.</hi> And note here alſo, hovv the other clauſe <hi>(par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not in her ſinnes)</hi> ſhevveth vvhat vve are to leave and renounce, namely, their ſinnes and iniquities, vvherein they tranſgreſſe the lavv of God, and not vvhatſoever is had or reteyned by them.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it is undenyable, and vve have heretofore urged it much againſt the Anabaptiſts, that the Church of Rome vvas at firſt, ſet in the vvaie of God, &amp; was not onely one of the Churches of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.8. &amp; 16.19.</note> but for their fayth and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vvas alſo very famous over the world. Since vvhich tyme, ſhee is fallen into great apoſtaſie and adulteries,<note place="margin">Eſa. 1.2. Ier. 2.21. Ezec. 16. &amp; 23. ch. 1 Kin. 12.28-33. &amp; 14.22.23.24. 2 Chro. 13.5. &amp;c.</note> as Iſrael did in former tymes. In all vvhich her adulterate &amp; apoſtate eſtate, ſhe hath notvvithſtanding ſtill kept (even to this day) ſundrie truths and ordinances of God, &amp; mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvith them her ovvne inventions &amp; traditions, as Iſrael alſo did.</p>
            <p>VVhich being obſerved aright cauſeth, a tvvofold conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19231:33"/>of her eſtate, as of Iſraels: one in reſpect of the truths and ordinances of God ſtill reteyned among them; another in reſpect of the mixture of their ovvne inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and abhominations vvithall: in regarde of the one, to hold and acknowledge the truth &amp; Church of God there, againſt the Anabaptiſts; in regarde of the other, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and obſerve their apoſtaſie and Babyloniſh confuſion, againſt Antichriſt: and for this cauſe, namely for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and mixture aforeſayd, to ſeparate from them, and vvitnes agaynſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: being alvvay carefull in our teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and practiſe to reteyne and maynteyne everie truth &amp; ordinance of God, vvhich was in that Church before their apoſtaſie, and is yet continued therein to this day: leaving onely and forſaking their corruptions and mixture of their ovvne inventions therevvith: leaſt othervviſe vve ſhould be brought our ſelves, or be occaſion to others to fall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Anabaptiſtrie, and divers other errours and evils, as by lamentable example of others vve have ſeen.</p>
            <p>Note here alſo a double conſideration about the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God made vvith his people: one in reſpect of the Lord himſelf, on the one part; the other in reſpect of the people taken into covenant by him, on the other part. <hi>Deut. 26.17.18.19. Iudg. 2.1, 20.</hi> For it often cometh to paſſe, that the people doe on their part tranſgreſſe &amp; break the covenant: vvhen the Lord doth not ſo on his part, but ſtill remembring his covenant, counts them his people, calls them to repentance, follovves them ſometymes with judgment, ſometymes vvith mereie and compaſſion, <hi>&amp;c. Levit. 26.15-45. Ezech. 16.59-62. Iudg. 2.1-20. &amp;c.</hi> Thus in Iſrael vvho vvere the Lords people, it may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how they goe a whoring after their ovvne inventions, fall into idolatrie and falſe vvorſhip, runne into ſinne after ſinne, and become an harlot, tranſgreſſing the covenant on their part. <hi>Exod. 32. Iudg. 2. and 3. with Pſa. 78.56-58.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19231:33"/>1 Sam. 7, 3, 4. 1 King. 12.28-33. and 14.22.23.24. with 2 Chron. 12. and 13. and 1 King. 19.10. Hoſ. 6.7. and 8.1.</hi> Yet the Lord breaks it not on his part, but ſometymes of himſelf, ſometymes at the intreatie of his prophets &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he ſpareth them, and doth not deſtroy them, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently give them a bill of divorce, according to their deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; but in his mercie (as a loving huſband) he cals them to repentance, and to that end he ſends unto them Prophets after Prophets a long tyme, to dravve the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to amendement, and cals them ſtill his people, and helps them and caſts the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not of: Yet ſo, as beſides his vvord ſent unto them, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo adjoyneth corrections &amp; puniſhmments; both for aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the quarrel of his covenant upon them, and for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their converſion by all maner meanes, vvhat may be. As in the books of Moſes and hiſtorie of the Iudges, Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, compared vvith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets may be ſeen. And particularly in the Scriptures here noted before, and the like: as <hi>Exod. 33. and 34. &amp;c. Levit. 26.14.15-25-42-44.45. Iudg. 2.1. &amp;c. Pſal. 78. 1 King. 13. and 16. and 18. 2 King. 5.8.15.17. with Ier. 51.5. and Ezech, 16.59.60. &amp;c. Hoſeas and Amos their Prophecies, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in theſe tvvo divers reſpects (ſometymes having reference to God, ſometymes to Iſrael) may there many things in the Scriptures be obſerved to be ſpoken diverſly. For example, Iſrael conſidered in themſelues and their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous eſtate, are ſayd to be vvithout God, vvithout Prieſt to teach, and vvithout lavv, to forſake and break the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Lord, to provoke the Lord to anger by their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; not to be the Lords vvife, but an harlot, going a vvhoring after their ovvne inventions, and having childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vvhooredomes; yea and that the Lord is not with Iſrael, or vvith any of Ephraim: <hi>2 Chron. 15.3. 1. King. 12.28.33. and 15.34. and 16.13.26.31-33. and 19.14. Hoſe. 2.1-5. and 5.3.4. and 8.1. and 9.1. with Pſalm. 106.29.39.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19231:34"/>Ezech. 16. and 23. chap. 2 Chron. 25.7.</hi> But agayne being conſidered in reſpect of the Lord and his covenant (into vvhich they vvere received, and) vvhich he breakes not on his part, but calls them to repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Lord is called their God; and they are called the people of the Lord; and their children, borne to the Lord; and Iſrael not to have ben a vvidovve forſaken of God; but that the Lord had mercie on them, and pitied them, and reſpected them, becauſe of his covenant vvith Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob; and that he vvould not deſtroy them, nor caſt them off from him as yet <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus continued Iſrael a long tyme, reſpected of the Lord, notvvithſtanding her apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, <hi>&amp;c. Iudg. 2, 1. &amp;c. 1 King. 18, 36. 2 King. 9, 6, Hoſ. 4.6, 12. and 5, 4. and 7, 10. and 8, 2. &amp; 9, 1. &amp; 14.1, 2. Amos, 7, 15. (with Pſal. 89.30-34. and Ezech. 16, 20, 60. and Ier. 51.5.) and 2 King. 13, 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notvvithſtanding in theſe tymes, the Prophets taught the people to plead vvith their mother, about her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, to ſeparate themſelves, and not to come at the places of their vvorſhip; nor to communicate vvith them, and bring their ſacrifices thither, becauſe in ſo doing they ſhould multiply their tranſgreſſions. <hi>&amp;c. Hoſ. 2, 1-5. and 4, 12.14.15. Amos 4, 4, 5. and 5, 4, 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all theſe things are vvritten for our learning, &amp; are to be applyed to the eſtate of the Churches in apoſtaſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel ſince Chriſt. <hi>Rom. 15, 4. with 1 Cor. 10.11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, beſides that the vvord <hi>Church</hi> is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes more largely, ſometymes more ſtrictly (vvhich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this queſtion likevviſe may be obſerved): there is yet further alſo a double regarde that may be had of apoſtate Churches in all ages, according as they are conſidered and ſpoken of, in compariſon with other people of divers ſorts. As namely Iſrael in apoſtaſie, being compared vvith the Syrians, Philiſtims, Moabites, and other nations, are called,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19231:34"/>and ought to be accounted the people of God, vvho have the onely true God for their God, <hi>&amp;c. 2 King. 3.8, 15.17. and 9, 6. &amp;c.</hi> But being compared vvith Iudah: vvhich ruled vvith God, and vvas faythfull vvith the Saincts, ſhe is called an harlot, not the vvife of God, but a vvhoore, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting adulterie, and compaſſing God about vvith lyes and deceit, <hi>&amp;c. Hoſ. 2.2.5. &amp; 4, 15. &amp; 5.3, 4. and 9, 1. and 11.12. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like maner the Church of Rome in apoſtaſie, being compared vvith the Ievves, Turkes, and Pagans, they are and ought to be accounted Chriſtians, and the Temple of God. VVhere alſo is verified that which the Apoſtle ſpake of Antichriſts <hi>ſitting in the Temple of God, 2 Theſ. 2.4.</hi> not the Temple of Ieruſalem (as ſome to turne away the truth, have imagined) but the Temple of Chriſtians, the Church of God, brought to the ſayth of Chriſt, and profeſſing to be Chriſtians: as may appeare by theſe ſcriptures, and the like compared together, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2.4. with Ezech. 43.7.8. Zath. 6.12.13. Epheſ. 2.11-13.19, 21. 2 Cor. 6.16. Rev. 11.19. and as it is alſo under stood by all ſound writers both old and new.</hi> But agayne, being compared vvith the auncient Church of Rome and other primitive Churches in the Apoſtles tymes, and ſuch as novv vvalke in their ſteps and in the good and old vvay, ruling vvith God, and abyding faythfull vvith his ſaincts: ſhe is called, and is to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an harlot, the great vvhoore, the mother of the whooredomes and abhominations of the earth, beleeving &amp; ſpeaking lyes in hypocriſie, giving heed to ſeducing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and having pleaſure in unrighteouſnes, <hi>&amp;c. Revel. 17.1.5. 1 Tim. 4.1.2.3. 2 Theſ. 2.3-10.</hi> 11.12.</p>
            <p>And thus there being (in divers reſpects) a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration had of the Church of Rome novv, as of Iſrael heretofore, it vvill appeare, hovv in one reſpect it may be ſayd, there is the Church of God or a true Church there, &amp;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19231:35"/>in another reſpect, there is an apoſtate or a falſe Church there: as it is ſayd by the Apoſtle, of one and the ſame wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that ſhe is dead and alive, in divers reſpects, 1 <hi>Tim. 5.6.</hi> And of the Iewes, that they are enimies in one reſpect, and yet beloved in another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, 28. So Iohn Baptiſt is Elias, and is not Elias, in divers reſpects, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1, 21. <hi>with Mat.</hi> 11.7-14. <hi>and</hi> 17.10-13. Iudas is an Apoſtle, and yet a divel; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.2.<hi>4. Ioh. 6.70.</hi> The Ievves are the children of Abraham, and yet the children of the divel. <hi>Ioh. 8.33.</hi>34. As the Prophets alſo called the Ievves, the ſeed of the vvicked, the ſeed of the adulterer, and a falſe ſeede in one reſpect; vvhen in other reſpects they acknovvledge them to be the ſeed of Abraham Iacob and Iſrael, and ſo a true ſeed and people of the Lord. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1, <hi>4. and 57,</hi> 3, <hi>4. with</hi> 41, <hi>8. and</hi> 45, 19. <hi>and</hi> 58, 1. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2, 1, 2. <hi>and 4,</hi> 13. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63, 16, 17. <hi>and 64, 9.

            <p>Novv to conclude this poynt, if theſe things &amp; the like, about apoſtate Churches, and the mixture of mans inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vvith Gods ordinances in apoſtaſie, be diſtinctly and carefully regarded, they may be (through the mercie of God) ſome good meanes to ſtay people from Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie &amp; other ill courſes, by the conſideration of the things that are to be obſerved on the one hand; and to bring men more ſoundly to ſeparation from the apoſtaſie of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, by the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the things to be obſerved on the other hand.</p>
            <p>Somevvhat (as it pleaſed God to give me to diſcerne) I obſerved &amp; vvrote, tending this vvay, long ſince: as may be ſeene in the Anſvver to Mr. Iacob,<note place="margin">Where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I noted my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted uſing of this caution therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, (in reſpect of this, or that eſtate) as alſo may be ſeen in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, where I ſpake with the ſame cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. p. 109. lin. 31.32.</note> 
               <hi>pag. 7.</hi> vvhere I ſpake of a double conſideration of Chriſtians, in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, <hi>true,</hi> and in an other, <hi>falſe:</hi> as alſo of ſalvation now had in the Church of Rome, <hi>pag.</hi> 13, <hi>and</hi> 47. vvhich ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implyeth, the people of God, and his covenant to be there. For vvhoſoever are ſaved, they are the people of God, and under his covenant in Chriſt. But ſo much and ſo particularly I obſerved not then, as ſince it hath pleaſed God to manifeſt thereabout. God openeth his vvil &amp; the myſteries of his vvord, vvhen and as he pleaſeth, that vve may ſtill perceive and acknovvledge, vve knovve but in part, and that we may be earneſt in prayer, &amp; by all meanes indevour to grovv in grace, and in the knovvledge of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And thus much I thought at this tyme by this occaſion to write unto you hereabout. By which you may perceive,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19231:36"/>hovv they vvhich for theſe things ſpeak of us, as if we were going back to England, might by this colour alſo ſay, vve are going back to Rome. And you may conſider vvith your ſelf, vvhether the people that lived in the Prophets tymes, and were ſet againſt them in thoſe dayes, might not vvith ſuch pretences and collections have ſayd, that the Prophets had ben declining to the apoſtate Iſraelites, when they called and eſteemed them to be the people of God, &amp; acknovvledged the circumciſion had in the apoſtaſie to be true circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But novv I vvill proceed to their next objection.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> For the ſixt and laſt exception of theirs, vvhich is about having the counſel &amp; help of the Engliſh Church at Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den (to vvhich therefore may be referred <hi>the ninth, and the other three particulars annexed unto it,</hi> in the printed copie): note here as in the other before, that they mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not the anſvvers that vvere then given hereabout. As namely, that vve vvould permit it: though (for ſome reaſons) vve abſteyned from deſiring it, and ſending for them about the matters in hand, or giving our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent ſo to doe. Of which poynt I ſhall vvrite more hereafter. But firſt I would here knovv, why they never ſpeak of this, that vve were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent to permit it? Or vvas our permiſſion of it, a denying of the practiſe of it, as novv they object in the printed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie? Did Paul deny that, vvhich he ſpake by permiſſion: though (for ſome cauſe) he did it not of commandement? <hi>1 Cor. 7, 6.</hi> Or did Moſes deny the practiſe of that, vvhich he permitted: though (for good cauſe) he vvould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne it? <hi>Deut. 24, 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This thing then might have ben better obſerved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded of them, then it hath ben: ſpecially ſeeing they knovve vve made queſtion of the lavvfulnes of doing any more in this caſe, then onely to permit it; and ſhevved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19231:36"/>then divers reaſons thereabout: ſome vvhereof I vvill novv mention. As 1. that now the other Church and we were in peace together; and if by this occaſion the peace betvveene us ſhould be broken, they ſhould not ſay of us, that vve ſent for them: our care being (vvhat in us layd) to nouriſh peace betvveen us, and to prevent &amp; cut off all occaſions of diviſion: <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Church of Leyden was in the ſame errour with thoſe of our people, who deſired their help. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, vve vviſhed it ſhould be conſidered, vvhether vve might approve of any to come in ſuch caſe, but ſuch as vve knevv to hold and maynteyne the truth according to the vvord of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That former experience vvith others might alſo juſtly cauſe us to be vvell adviſed and circumſpect vvhat to doe in this behalf. VVhich vvhen vve vvrote of to Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, them ſelues acknovvledged that it vvas ſuch as <hi>might juſtly make us cautelous:</hi> but vvithall, they vvrote hovv vve might eſteeme better of them then of the other in divers reſpects, as being <hi>more ſtudious of our peace, and more carefull of the cauſe of Chriſt, and that whereas the other would have brought in new doctrines and fayths amongſt us, they if in any thing they oppoſed any of us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note here the terme of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition thus uſed.</note> 
               <hi>ſhould doe it in defence of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and auncient fayth, both ours and theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That vvhen vve vvrote to them agayne hereabout, vve acknovvledged great differences to be betvveene them and the other: but touching the doctrines and queſtions controverted, vve prayed them to conſider, that the fayth of this Church, was that onely which is grounded upon the vvord of God in the vvritings of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: and that ſo our fayth is the common and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fayth which was held by the Church of Iſrael of old, &amp; by the Primitive churches of the Ievves and Gentiles ſince the comming of Chriſt. From which vvherein ſoever we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19231:37"/>had ſwarved in fayth or practiſe, it had ben our aberration, and not our fayth indeed. Againſt which alſo whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould be brought in, reteyned, or defended, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our common and auncient fayth, both theirs &amp; ours. And vvhether therefore it vvere about <hi>the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Government of the Church</hi> (as about all theſe wee had found oppoſition) it came to a like end. Alſo, that in all the three vve had reſiſted the perſons ſpoken of (being ſuch as would have brought in among us new doctrines &amp; fayths in them all) though in the laſt vve had done it leaſt of all: and that novv ſtill we purpoſed by the grace of God to ſtand againſt all, that eyther in all or any of them ſhould oppoſe againſt the truth. And here, by this occaſion, we intreated to knovv of them, whether they alſo were not like mynded with the other men aforeſayd, agreeing with them in the points of the church Officers and Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they held and vvrote thereof, before they fell to their errours of Anabaptiſme <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVhereunto vve had no anſwer at all from them. VVhich is a thing alſo to be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That in this tyme, &amp; in the ſame letters, we wrote to them about a letter ſent unto them by many of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple concerning theſe matters (as themſelues had certified us) deſiring to haue a copie of it, together with the names that vvere ſubſcribed thereunto, and the things delivered by word of mouth (as was told us) that we might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſider of theſe things, &amp; of our peoples dealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. And vvhen thus vve could not obteyne it of them, vve alledged divers reaſons to perſwade them to ſend it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, <hi>viz,</hi> that the matters written of vvere touching our publick affayres &amp; eſtate, whatſoever might concerne any of us more particularly beſides; that the perſons vvhich ſent it, were me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of our Church; that if the thing done vvere good, it vvould abide the light, and they ſhould doe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19231:37"/>vvell to follovv the Apoſtles example, vvho ſhevved the Church of Corinth both the parties and the particulars ſignified unto him by them, 1 <hi>Cor. 1, 11.</hi> but if it were evill, then it behoved them ſo much the more to give,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.2 Exod. 20.12, 16. Iob, 29.16 Prov. 18.17. Act. 20.28. &amp;c.</note> and us to have from them, the full knovvledge of the things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, that it might be ſeen they did not partake with them in their evill, and that vve might doe our dutie according to that which layd upon us in this behalf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they vvrote their purpoſe was to come unto us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the requeſt of the brethren vvhich had moved the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they gave us occaſion to ſignifie unto them, that till vve knew who thoſe brethren vvere, and what had paſſed between them, we could not ſo well admit thereof, for the reaſons before rendred unto them; that we were conſtrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the more to defier them to ſend it us, becauſe vvhen the Elders here asked ſome for it (vvhom they underſtood to be of thoſe parties) they anſwered, that here they had not eyther the Originall perfit, or a perfit copie, neyther any note of the names ſubſcribed; &amp; finally, that if they would not ſend it, but ſtill keep it from us, then they and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here gave us cauſe to refuſe to haue dealing vvith them about the things ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, &amp; that ſo the hinderance ſhould be in themſelves; &amp; therefore if they would there ſhould be no ſuch hinderance, but that vve ſhould afterward haue reaſoning with them about the matters aforeſaid, and did in deed ſeeke the peace &amp; good of this Church, they ſhould ſhevv it forth by ſending unto us a copie of thoſe things, whereabout vve had vvritten unto them three tymes: <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet notvvithſtanding any intreatie or reaſons alledged about it, we could not by any meanes get a copie thereof eyther there or here. VVhat vve heard was in it, &amp; other circumſtances &amp; dealing about it, I doe omit now to ſpeak of: and vvill proceede to other things about the matter in hand.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:19231:38"/>
            <p>And next of all, it is to be obſerved, that to all the letters and matters aforeſayd written by us to Leyden hereabout, M. A. himſelf ſubſcribed as vvell as vve. So that if it were evill in us, it vvas alſo evill in himſelf. VVhich let him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge, knovvledge, taking avvay the former reaſons, and ſhewing it by the vvord of God, that vve may doe likevviſe. Or if he can vvarrant his ovvne doing therein, vvhy doth he thus object againſt us that very thing, vvherein himſelf joyned and ſubſcribed vvith us at that tyme? Let him alſo tell us, vvhether therein he denyed the practiſe of that arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion (about having the counſel and help of that Church): or vvhether he yeelded unto it by permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but abſteyned from ſending for them, or giving ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to their coming, for the reaſons aforeſayd. Let him alſo call to minde, vvhether himſelf (as I remember) did not ſay, or (at leaſt) heard ſome of us ſay, upon former experience had vvith others, that whiles we lived vve would take heed, how we conſented to any other in like ſort to come publikly into the Church, vvhom we knewe aforehand to be in errour, and ſo purpoſed to mainteyne the ſame.</p>
            <p>But be it that we ſhould haue deſired this, or at leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to haue it deſired, as is implyed here: yet though vve did it not, <hi>the help of that Church was procured and obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> as is ſayd here and in the printed copie. So then the thing it ſelf vvas had, by their ovvne ſaying: how ever there wanted our deſire of it or conſenting thereunto: Though yet they ſhould not forget, that vve conſented to the permiſſion of it, and ſhevved reaſons of our reſrayning from doing more in this caſe, as is aforeſayd. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when their help was procured, and that they were come: how vvere the things then caryed? VVhere (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſpeak of that vvhich paſſed from them, &amp; to keep to thoſe that concerne our ſelues) they all knowe, that we
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19231:38"/>reaſoned vvith them publikly about the matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And that vve conſulted &amp; adviſed vvith them about ſome courſe to be taken for procuring and keeping peace betvveen us. And this not onely at that tyme, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward alſo both by vvord and vvriting. So then vve both reaſoned vvith them about the poynts in difference, &amp; we uſed their counſel and help hovv to come to a good iſſue thereabout. And thus themſelues vvill not deny, that the thing it ſelf ſpoken of in the Confeſſion, vvas in this ſort obſerved by us, as is aforeſayd. But hovv did they obſerve it themſelues, vvhen they brake away and left us, vvhiles vve vvere vvriting one to another (the other Church and we) concerning the matters propounded and fallen out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen us hereabout? Of vvhich I ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeak more hereafter: when firſt I haue noted a few things further about the former matter, concerning our ſelues, &amp; the Article ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>For our ſelues, beſides the other things aforeſayd, vve ſignified alſo, that vve vvould not refuſe to conferre &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vvith the brethren of Leyden at any tyme about the matter in hand, ſo as their comming vvere eyther of them ſelues, or by the requeſt of them here that deſired it, and vvithout our approbation, for the reaſons ſpoken of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And accordingly, vvhen they came hither,<note place="margin">Their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with conſent of the reſt.</note> vve performed it, notwithſtanding any thing that had paſſed before about theſe things.</p>
            <p>For the Article it ſelf, obſerue the clauſes in it, and the Scriptures cited for confirmation of it. For the clauſes in it, note hovv it is ſayd,<note place="margin">Conf. a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>that every particular Congregation is as a compact and knitt citie in it ſelf,</hi> and therefore ſhould uſe all good and lavvfull meanes, that may further their compacting and knitting together in the truth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon fayth: but not any ſuch as may cauſe or at leaſt colour the dividing of them aſunder. Alſo, that the churches ſhould
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19231:39"/>
               <hi>all walk by one and the ſame rule, and by all meanes convenient, have the counſell and help one of another, in all needfull affaires of the Church, as members of the ſame bodie in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon fayth, under Christ their onely head.</hi> If this then be a rule for us, it is ſo likevviſe for all other Churches, that vvhen there fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out queſtion about an errour among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſhould deſire the counſel and help of ſuch Churches thereabout, as they knowe to be corrupted vvith the ſame errour, and not purpoſed to leave it, but to defend it, ſuppoſing it to be the truth. And vvhat conveniencie it vvere (not to ſpeak of the lavvfulnes of it) or hovv needfull, to call ſuch as vve knovve to be in errour, that ſo our people might ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be the more corrupted, or have the more colour for their errour &amp; evill dealing, you may conſider vvith your ſelf. Or if vve had ſent for them, or approved it, might we not haue ben acceſſarie to the meanes, by vvhich the truth might haue ben hindred, and our people more confirmed in errour? And vvhere then is the vvarrant for ſuch vval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king?</p>
            <p>For the Scriptures that are cited for confirmation of the Article aforeſaid, firſt obſerve (about the point of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betvveen us) hovv the Scriptures of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are alledged aſvvell as of the nevv: and thoſe alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eſtate of Iſrael, applyed to our tymes and caſes novv. Secondly conſider, vvhether thoſe Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or vvill vvarrant a Church, to ſend for ſuch or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their counſel and help, vvhom they knovv to be in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour about the poynts queſtioned and dealt in, and by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the parties that trouble the church may be more ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their errours and evils thereabout. VVhich if they doe, or if any other doe it (that are not cited here) then ought vve and all to yeeld thereunto. Othervviſe if the help and courſes deſired be not ſuch as are approved in the vvord of God, we might tempt God in atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pting of them:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19231:39"/>and therefore muſt be carefull to follovv that onely which hath warrant from thence, whereby the truth may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, the ſafetie and libertie of the Church preſerved, and occaſion cut off from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that deſire occaſion thereagainſt.</p>
            <p>And beſides the things aforeſaid, vvhy did not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo deſire to haue the counſel and help of the Dutch and French Churches, that vvere here at hand round about us? If they ſay, becauſe they thought they vvere in errour about the matter in queſtion, and ſo might haue hindred the truth, and haue ben againſt them, and for us: then by it may be perceived vvhat their ovvne judgment is about this particular (being ſimply conſidered in it ſelf) and in this behalf what the waight of this their exception is againſt us. If they aunſvver any other thing, it may accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly be conſidered of, as it ſhall be found to be. And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto concerning the Article aforeſaid, and ſundrie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars that paſſed betvveen us by this occaſion, not ſpoken of by them.</p>
            <p>Now touching <hi>the three particulars</hi> annexed to the ninth objection in the printed copie: the firſt is, that <hi>before their parting, they offered, that notwithstanding our differences of judgment, they would continew together, if our former practiſe might be reteyned:</hi> VVhich is as if they ſhould ſay, they vvould haue continued vvith us, if vve vvould haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in errour and evil (ſo found and acknovvledged by us): ſuffring the ordinance of God (touching the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) to be troden under foot; the Elders to be deſpiſed &amp; abuſed by the people; and the vvhole Church to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſubject to contentions and ſcandals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, vvhy doe they not alſo mention, vvhat vve offered to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? vvhich ſeeing they ſpeak not of, vve will: <hi>namely,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their parting vve offred to beare vvith them in their difference of judgment, if they vvould be content to walke peaceably vvith the Church in that their difference: but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19231:40"/>this vvas refuſed.</p>
            <p>The next particular they ſpeak of, is, <hi>that then they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a peaceable parting; &amp; to be two diſtinct Congregations, each practiſing as they were perſwaded, yet nouriſhing love &amp; unitie.</hi> A peaceable parting we graunt they deſired in vvord, but in deed ſtayed not vvith us, but departed vvhiles vve vvere conſidering and adviſing vvhether it could lavvfully be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or not. And touching that particular <hi>of being two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Congregations</hi> of us in this citie <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſhewed them divers reaſons, vvhy vve could not in this caſe agree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And of thoſe reaſons vve had ſpeach vvith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here, and vvrote to the Church of Leyden: ſignifying vvithall, that if vve could otherwiſe better diſcerne vvhat vvere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vvill of God herein, vve ſhould (God vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) ſo receiue and vvalk. VVhich letter (vvith the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons therein conteyned) is hereafter noted dovvne. Yet notvvithſtanding they ſtayed not, till we had an anſwer thereof from Leyden, but ſoone after departed from us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that other meanes alſo vvas uſed (by writing) vvhich might at leaſt haue perſwaded them to ſtay and doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe then they did. Of vvhich I ſhall alſo ſpeak more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>The third particular is, about <hi>their procuring the help of the Engliſh Church at Leyden, without our conſent</hi> (of vvhich I haue ſpoken here before) &amp; about <hi>a waie of peace propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by us, &amp; agreed unto by the Church of Leyden &amp; our ſelues, and yet afterward reverſed by us, &amp;c.</hi> Touching vvhich they doe here as before, omit divers things needful to be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and remembred: As firſt, vvhat the thing it ſelf is that was propounded by us, namely, <hi>that for ſuch as could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with proteſtation peaceably to walke with eyther Church (at Leyden or here) it ſhould be free for them to goe from the one Church and Pastor to the other: ſo as there were no other cauſe lying against them.</hi> This vvas in deed propounded by my
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19231:40"/>ſelf: having much thought and conſidered (vvhat I could) of any lavvfull meanes, by vvhich we might come to ſome good end and agreement, after our ſo long and lamentable troubles and contentions, as vve had ben exerciſed withall. VVhich when I had propounded, they of Leyden anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>that they were glad to hear of ſuch a motion, litle thinking that we had ben ſo inclyning to peace and agreement:</hi>
               <note place="margin">This to my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance was the effect of the things that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed here about.</note> 
               <hi>which if they had thought, they ſhould haue caryed themſelues otherwiſe towards us, then they had done. And for the thing it ſelf, that they would conſider of it with their Church; and if eyther they or we mynded otherwiſe by the word of God, that we ſhould ſignify it.</hi> VVhich caution being thus ſpoken of by them, my ſelf then ſaid (as I remember) that I had thought ſo to haue ſpoken alſo concerning it, but had forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (when I ſpake) to mention it. And ſo then it vvas minded of us both to be conſidered of and proſequuted vvith this condition and limitation, <hi>of being found lawfull by the word of God.</hi> And let this for hereafter be ſtill remembred, becauſe it vvill cleare all the queſtion about this matter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, at the firſt treating of this matter between us, the Officers of the Church of Leyden (then preſent) did ſo conceiue it, as that our people which would not walk with this Church, as is aforeſaid, ſhould goe and remayne vvith them at Leyden. VVhich ſome of them here obſerving &amp; excepting againſt it, in reſpect of their meanes of living had here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were anſwered by them of Leyden, that they muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to ſuffer or beare the croſſe of Chriſt vvith them, or to ſuch effect. Then alſo concerning the courſe aforeſaid, there vvas noted a double conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: The one, about the doing of it ſo,<note place="margin">The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the poynt which they doe ſo much urge.</note> 
               <hi>as to live and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne with the other Church whither they ſhould goe:</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, about the doing of it ſo, <hi>as that having once gone and joyned thewſelues to the other Church, they might then returne agayne to the towne where they lived before, and there live apart
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19231:41"/>from the Church, whereof they had formerly ben.</hi> And hereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, having ſpeach about theſe tvvo courſes: the firſt vvas ſooner conceired of and generally liked of all; the latter vvas leſſe conceived of and more called in queſtion (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvard did appeare) though for myne ovvn part I did my ſelf ſo minde and like of it at that time. And vvhen ſome among us propounded, that ſuch as vvent from us to Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and joyned to that Church, ſhould not be diſmiſſed back by them againe, to live apart from us in this tovvne: both my ſelf and the Elders of the other Church (to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance) anſwered, that this matter vvould concerne that Church to which they ſhould joyne to look unto, and ſo vvas to be left unto them. But afterward, conſidering yet further of the lavvfulnes of ſuch diſmiſſion thither, &amp; hither agayne: I ſhewed my minde herein to be altered, &amp; divers reaſons thereabout. Of vvhich I ſhall ſpeak hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vvhen I come to that matter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, vvhen the matters aforeſaid, vvhich vve had propounded, vvere communicated vvith the Church at Leyden, and their Elders returned hither againe, they ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifyed that theſe things came ſodainly upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Church, yet for the preſent (as they could in that tyme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) they liked vvell of it, or to ſuch effect. So now againe at this tyme we had more ſpeach together thereabout. The former of the tvvo courſes (as I ſaid before) vvas generally vvell approved, and conſented unto. The latter vvas more doubted of and more queſtion made about it; &amp; in the end more &amp; more diſliked by divers, the more that it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be the brethrens purpoſe ſo to doe. And this moſt appeared the next morning, when the likelyhood of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that vvas the night before, was then ſo changed, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> further reaſoning and conſideration thereof, as we could not accord therabout. And ſo the Officers of the other Church (ſignifying that they had great occaſion to returne
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19231:41"/>home, and could then no longer ſtay, departed, and ſaid, it vvould be heavie to their Church to heare that the things vvere come to no better iſſue between us. Yet vvhen they were gone, we ſtill continued ſpeach among our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe things, being ſorie that they ſtood thus, and that no better tidings ſhould be caried to the other Church. And then upon ſome ſpeach ſo had together (as vve could in that ſhort time) we came to this iſſue, that we thought it beſt to agree upon the matter aforeſaid in this ſort, that whatſoever blame ſhould follovve hereupon (if our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vvere by them of Leyden diſmiſſed to liue here apart from us in this citie) it ſhould lye upon them, and vve be free of it. And ſo thereupon we preſently ſent three vvith this meſſage after the brethren of Leyden (if they could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake them in tyme) to ſignifie thus much unto them, that they might alſo ſignifie it unto their Church. And this (I thinke) is the agreement ſpoken of. VVhich vvhen it vvas in this manner agreed upon, ſome of the brethren preſent (there being then but a ſevv at that tyme) came to the Elders, ſhewing hovv they thought it needfull that this ſhould be ſpoken of the Lords day after: &amp; others ſay to this day, they never conſented unto it: and ſome, that they ſaid then, it vvas unlavvfull. And theſe men the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, it may be, vvould be loth to ſtand to their ovvn po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions about it, that in a controverſie the greater part ſhould be the Church (whether the Elders be vvith them or againſt them) and that the matters of ſinne and queſtion touching the brethren ſhould be heard and ended on the Lords day. But I vvill proceede on to other matters that follovved aftervvard about theſe things.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, vvhiles things ſtood thus mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g us, we had the Lords day following ſpeach hereabout againe: at vvhich tyme there vvas a nevv motion made for an other courſe to be taken, by which we might keep together, rather then
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19231:42"/>to part aſunder according to the other courſe ſpoken of, VVhich being then propounded, and not agreed upon, vvas left to further conſideration. And ſo that week vvee wrote to the Church of Leyden thereabout.</p>
            <p>By vvhich occaſion, after the aforeſaid treating of theſe things had by vvord of mouth, there paſſed alſo ſome let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betvveen us concerning them. VVhich although in divers reſpects vve could be willing to keep among our ſelues: yet conſidering in vvhat ſort and vvith what ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal the brethren aforeſaid haue ſince divided themſelues from us, and that the reproch of it is ſpread farre and neare not onely by others, but even by their ovvne letters and vvritings thereabout, to the great diſhonour of God, and hindrance of the truth: and that the knowledge of theſe things vvill be a good meanes for all both to ſettle their owne judgment better, and to deale with them or others concerning theſe matters, as there ſhal be occaſion: we have therefore thought it not amiſſe to note down here the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the letters aforeſaid that paſſed betvveene us herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, before the others departing from us. VVhich we may alſo the better doe, becauſe they are but few and ſhort. Firſt therefore, when we had afterward had further ſpeach among our ſelues, as is aforeſaid, and had not yet heard fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church at Leyden agayne vvhat they thought of the matter and meſſage aforeſaid, or vvhether they conſented unto it or not: we vvrote unto them as follovveth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beloved, touching the things that haue now lately ben ſpoken off between the two Churches, yours and ours, about the diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch on cyther part as are not content with proteſtation peaceably to walk in their difference of judgment, we have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to entreat the continuance of your conſideration yet further thereabout: 1. becauſe your ſelves ſignified it came ſodainly upon your Church: and if eyther you or we mynded otherwiſe by the word of God, we ſhould after ſignify it: Wherefore we expect
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19231:42"/>to heare whether you continew like mynded as heretofore. 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is with us a new motion of our walking together thus, by bearing one with another, ſo as for peace to permit of a double practiſe among us, that thoſe that are mynded eyther way, ſhould keep a like courſe together, as we would doe if we were aſunder, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the perſons ſhall be that haue the cauſes. Which way, if it may be found warrantable by the word of God, and peaceable unto and among our ſelues, we hope all that love peace in holynes will accord. Theſe things as we are to conſider of, ſo pray we you to doe the like with us and for us, that we may doe that which is moſt to Gods glorie and our mutuall comfort. Thus &amp;c. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam Novemb. 5. old style. 1610.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And note here, how we both conſidered further of theſe things, and ſtill limited our conſultation and purpoſe with this caution, <hi>if the things propounded were found warrantable by the word of God.</hi> VVhich is to be obſerved for the waight of it againſt theſe perſons, who haue taken ſuch a courſe, together vvith their opinions, as can never be vvarranted by the vvord of God. Next follovveth the letter and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver, which then vve received from the Church of Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den agayne: vvhich vvas thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Touching the agreement (Brethren) between the Churches for our mutuall peace, and the relief of the conſciences of our brethren, we did and doe repute the ſame as full and abſolute on both ſides, except eyther ſome better courſe can be thought on, or this manifeſted to be evill, and that then it be reverſed with the mutuall conſent of both Churches. And for this laſt motion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a double practiſe, as we are glad of the great and godly deſire to continew together, in it manifested, ſo doe we not ſee, how it can ſtand eyther with our peace, or it ſelf: but that it will not onely nouriſh, but even neceſſarily beget endles contentions, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men diverſly mynded ſhall have buſines in the Church. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would pleaſe the Lord ſo far to enlarge your hearts on both ſides (brethren) as that this middle waie be held, namely, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19231:43"/>the matter of offence, might firſt be brought for order, prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and prevention of unneceſſarie trouble, unto the Elders as the Church governours, (though it is like we for our parts ſhall not ſo practiſe in this particular) and after, if things be not there ended, to the Church of Elders and brethren, there to be judged on ſome ordinarte knowen day ordinarily, the admonition being carryed according to the alteration practiſed and agreed upon by all parts, till it ſhall pleaſe the God of wiſdome, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights, by the further conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; diſcuſſing of things, eyther in word or writing, to manifest otherwiſe for our joynt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, it would ſurely make much to the glorie of God, &amp; the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of their mouthes which are ſo wide opened upon us in reſpect of our dayly diſsipations, and ſhould be to us matter of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, whoſe ſoules doe long after peace, &amp; abhorre the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and that thus walking in peace and holynes, we might all beg at Gods hands the healing and pardon of all our infirmities, &amp; ſo be readie to heale and forgive the infirmities one of another in love. And with this prayer unto God for you, and for our ſelues, we reſalute you in the Lord Ieſus, Leyden November 14. 1610.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This vvas their letter. VVherin obſerue theſe things about the matters that paſſed betvveen us. Firſt, that here is the anſvver vvhich they gaue us about the agreement and meſſage aforeſaid, as alſo to the letters which aftervvard we ſent unto them. Secondly, that touching the agreement they limit their conſent unto it &amp; their account of it with a double exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For though they ſay <hi>they repute the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be full and abſolute on both ſides,</hi> yet they ſpeak it with limitation and exception: as in deed vvas good and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to doe, both in reſpect of the thing it ſelf, and ſeeing at the firſt propounding of the matter, it was ſo mynded by them and us to be conſidered of with limitation, <hi>of being found lawfull by the word of God.</hi> Thirdly, that the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vvhich here they made, vvere theſe, <hi>except eyther ſome
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19231:43"/>better courſe could be thought on, or this manifeſted to be evill.</hi> So then by this it is evident, that if eyther a better courſe could be ſhevved, or this manifeſted to be evill, they did not yeeld or repute the agreement to be full and abſolute.</p>
            <p>Novv touching <hi>the ſhewing of a better courſe,</hi> it appeareth by both of theſe letters, theirs and ours, that both of us vvere thinking of it, &amp; therefore propounded other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (each to other) to be conſidered. To vvhich end may be obſerved here, their propounding of another waie unto us for peace &amp; agreement, vvith divers reaſons to perſwade thereunto. VVhich had ben altogether in vayne, for them to propound or us to think of, if the other had ben abſolute vvithout exception, and irrevocable vvithout alteration, though it vvere found never ſo evill or unlavvfull.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>the manifeſting of it to be evill,</hi> the more vve thought of it, the worſe we found it to be: and mynded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reaſons againſt it: vvhich firſt vve ſignified here to the brethren themſelues, and had ſome reaſoning vvith them thereof, but could not agree thereabout: and then we vvrote of them alſo to the Church at Leyden, as by the next letter here follovving will appeare. And we need not doubt, but if the thing which they purpoſed here, had gone forvvard vvith our conſent, it would aftervvard haue ben much abuſed againſt us by others, if not alſo by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: ſpecially as it appeared ſtill more &amp; more to be in deed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them: the thing being ſuch, as although it had never ben thought or ſpoken of among us, yet it vvould (in a matter of this waight) haue ben found a great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. But it being ſpoken of, and manifeſted, that they vvould but goe to the other Church to joyne unto them there, &amp; then preſently returne hither agayne to remayne and liue here in the ſame tovvne, apart from us, of vvhom they vvere: vvhat vvould this haue proved in deed, but ſcandal and colluſion, and haue ben turned upon us vvith
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19231:44"/>the more reproch, becauſe vve conſented unto it?</p>
            <p>As for that other clauſe in their letter, where they write <hi>that the agreement ſhould be reverſed with the mutuall conſent of both Churches:</hi> note that this vvas their propounding thereof unto us, vvhich vve vvere to conſider of, vvhether vve vvould aſſent unto it or not. And that in all ſuch caſes, wherein it may fall out that eyther ſinne may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, or the truth hindred, or the libertie of the Church impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, it behoveth all carefully to take heed vvhat they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and yeeld unto: yea that if any conditions or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made, vvhich can not vvithout ſinne be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it is better to breake then to keep them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly obſerue here, hovv the courſe about dealing in matters propounded in this letter, and not yeelded unto by the others,<note place="margin">Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ept ſome of them.</note> ſhevveth playne ynough, hovv greatly theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oppugned the ordinance of God touching the Elders hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and judging of cauſes and perſons, and hovv highly they lift up the people therein: ſpecially vvhen the things noted before about this queſtion, are joyned and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red herevvith. Novv it follovveth, that vve ſet dovvne our next letter ſent unto the other Church about the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid: vvhich alſo vvas the laſt that paſſed betvveen us, afore the others parting from us. And it vvas thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your letter (brethren) we received and read publikly. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, we haue occaſion to ſignify ſome things unto you thereabout. And first touching the agreement treated of between us, that for ſuch of us as will not come thither to remayne with you, but purpoſe ſtill to liue here, in this citie, apart from us: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there be ſome that could be content notwithstanding ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe them, yet there are others of us, that having more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of it, thinke it not lawfull to haue any hand in conſenting thereunto, and meane therefore to reverſe our former agreement unto it, beſides that divers of us ſay, they never conſented here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And further, ſome of us alſo beginne to thinke that it will
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19231:44"/>be found unlawfull to keep ſpirituall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with them in ſuch eſtate, how ever we may ſtill reteyne with them civill ſocietie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The reaſons mynded, why not ſo to diſmiſſe them, nor to haue ſpirituall fellowſhip with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſuch eſtate &amp; walking, are theſe:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Becauſe we can not finde warrant for it in the word of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Becauſe they refuſe diſobey and ſpeak evill of the truth and waie of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Becauſe they refuſe to continew and keep co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with us, though they may be ſuffered to walke with us in peace with proteſtation in their difference of judgment.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of them profeſſe they will not deale in cauſes (as may fall out between us) by way of proteſtation, neyther when they are with us, nor when they are from us.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Becauſe they goe not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one Church and Paſtour to another, ſo to live and remayne: but purpoſe (when they haue come &amp; joyned unto you) then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to returne, &amp; to live here in this towne apart from us.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. <hi>Becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe by ſuch walking of theirs, great reproach will come upon us all, with much diſhonour to God, and hinderance to the truth, what in them lyeth.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. <hi>Lastly, becauſe we thinke there ſhould alway be ſomewhat in ſuch caſes uſed, as whereby the Lord may worke upon their conſciences, to conſider their eſtate, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and yeeld to the truth and waie of God which they haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto refuſed and oppugned, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus we thought to acquaint you with theſe things, and the reaſons thereabout. Which yet are ſo mynded of us, as if eyther among our ſelues or by others we ſhall hereafter better diſcerne what is according to the will of God herein, we ſhall (Godwilling) be ready ſo to receiue and walke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As touching the the double practiſe, miſliked by you, although in deed it may ſeeme ſomewhat ſtraunge and difficult, yet for the preſent ſome of us could like better of it, then of a parting: but the brethren differing from us will not admit of it. Neyther will they yeeld to that middle courſe propounded in your letter. Yet haue we left it, with the former things, to their further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And how ſoever it pleaſeth the Lord to diſpoſe of us, our
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19231:45"/>trust is that he will worke all in the end to the furtherance of his truth, and peace of his Church in Ieſus Chriſt. To whoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious protection and guydance we commend you, &amp;c. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam. Novemb. 19.1610.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This letter being here publikly read, vvas then ſent to the Church at Leyden. VVhereabout let theſe things alſo be obſerved here. Firſt, that vve reverſed not our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning ſuch, as vvould goe and liue vvith the Church at Leyden: but onely about ſuch as vvould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne and liue there, but purpoſed to returne, &amp; liue here apart from us in this citie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that for this alſo we ſhewed divers reaſons moving us ſo to doe: and that, both here by vvord of mouth, and by vvriting to Leyden, afore they vvent avvay from us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that vvhereas tvvo courſes vvere propounded for the keeping of us together, the one by us here, the other by the Church at Leyden, they vvould not admit of eyther of them: neyther remayned vvith us, till vve had from Leyden an anſvver of this letter, and of the reaſons contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein: but vvere ſo ſet upon parting from us, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vve heard from them, they divided them ſelues from us; and ſo haue continued to this day. Yea notvvithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that before this their parting, and beſides all the other meanes formerly uſed, vve offred alſo to try out in vvriting the matter betvveen us, touching our difference about the Churches government, and underſtanding of <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> vvhich likevviſe they refuſed. VVhereof I ſhall ſpeak more particularly hereafter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that vvhen they left us, they vvent not to Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, there to joyne them ſelues to that Church, according to the agreement before ſpoken of: but vvent apart from us here, forſaking the fellovvſhip vvhich they had with us, and met together in another place of this tovvne. VVhich
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19231:45"/>is much to be obſerved, not onely for the thing it ſelf, but becauſe that thus them ſelues in their going away followed not the agreement betvveene the other Church and us, vvhereof they ſpeak. And ſo that vvhich they did, vvas both vvithout our agreement, and the Churches of Leyden, for ought vve knovve. Neyther haue they here ſet dovvne the cauſe that moved them, not to goe to Leyden firſt and joyne there (according to the former agreement) afore they had taken this courſe of meeting apart from us here. If they vvould haue this taken for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of that vvhich they intended indeed, that if they had gone to Leyden, and joyned there, it ſhould haue ben, but for the ſatiſfying of our mindes, vvhom they ſavve to be troubled about the diſmiſſion of them; and that in deed they meant not to liue and remayne with that Church and Paſtor there, but vvhen they had ſo done, then to come &amp; liue apart from us, as novv they doe: vve and others may accordingly eſteeme thereof, and take it as a further confirmation of the reaſons alledged for the reverſing of our conſent to the agreement aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a clauſe inſerted by them in their third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular novv treated of, vvhere they ſay, <hi>that in the treatie of the Agreement it was teſtifyed by the Elders of the Church of Leyden, that unleſſe it were to the apparant undoing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of their families, they ſhould not be diſmiſſed agayne to dwell here:</hi> which whether it did any way moue them in this behalf to doe as they did, themſelues know beſt. My ſelf cannot ſay, that it did. But this is ſure, that ſome haue gone from this Church &amp; citie to liue in the other, in reſpect of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate, and in hope of bettering of it: though none of them did ſo, upon the former agreement, and in reſpect thereof, that I can remember.</p>
            <p>And (to note it here by this occaſion) vvell may it be that this ſpeach of the Elders of that Church vvas a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19231:46"/>meanes to perſvvade us much to the agreement aforeſaid: and that vvhen it appeared, hovv them ſelues vvere purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to liue vvith the other Church &amp; Paſtor there, but to returne and liue apart from us here, that then vve did the more thinke of it, vvhether it vvere lavvfull for us to conſent thereunto: and thereuppon ſhewed the reaſons aforeſayd for the reverſing of our former agreement unto it. VVhich reaſons alſo together vvith their owne purpoſe of living here apart from us; they ſhould haue done vvell to haue ſpoken of in their vvriting, and not to haue ſayd onely, <hi>that although in the treatie of the agreement it was teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Elders of that Church, that unleſſe it were to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant undoing of them, and of their families, they ſhould not be diſmiſsed agayne to dwell here: yet becauſe they would not abſolutely promiſe to leaue this citie, we would not stand to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement which our ſelues had made.</hi> For they knovve both their owne purpoſe aforeſaid, and that vve ſhewed divers reaſons, vvhy vve thought it not lavvfull for us to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevv, but to reverſe, our conſent to the diſmiſſion of ſuch as would not remayne vvith the other Church, but purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtill to liue here in this citie apart from us.</p>
            <p>And in deed in ſuch caſes, if things ſhould concerne our ſelues, even vvith certaine loſſe and hurt to us and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, yet ſhould vve not make our outvvard eſtate the ground or rule of our religion or religious actions, but vve ſhould alvvay firſt look and conſider vvhat is lavvfull for us by the word of God to conſent unto in others, or to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe our ſelues: and then in fayth to vvalk before the Lord, being upright, and committing our vvay unto him, vvho vvill bring it to paſſe. <hi>Pſal. 37.3, 4, 5. with Gen. 12.1. and 17.1.</hi> Note alſo here, how in the two laſt particulars of the printed copie, they haue this clauſe thriſe, that we would not agree to ſtand to the agreement, <hi>unles they left this citie;</hi> and haue not once any vvhere, <hi>unleſse they went from one
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19231:46"/>Church and Pastour to another:</hi> the verie naming vvhereof is ſuch, as caryeth vvaight of reaſon vvith it againſt them, and for us.</p>
            <p>Moreover, concerning the poynt and Article ſpoken of, <hi>about having the counſel and help of other Churches,</hi> note alſo that hovvever they ſpeak much of it, yet in deed they did not follow it them ſelues; in that whiles the other Church and vve vvere treating &amp; vvriting about the matters afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, they ſtayed not till vve had done, to ſee vvhat would be the end of our conſultation, as it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to diſpoſe: but vvhen they knevve vve had vvritten unto Leyden, and vvhereabout, and that yet vve had received no anſvver from them agayne, they brake away from us; and tooke alſo another courſe then that which was agreed upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as is aforeſaid. And ſo themſelues herein obſerved not that in deed, which they ſpeake in vvord, about <hi>having the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel &amp; help one of another, in all needfull affaires of the Church, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And be it that eyther vve or the of Leyden (from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vve heard not in this tyme) ſhould be vvanting or fayling in any thing hereabout: (as vvho in ſuch difficulties and troubles are not ſubject to be?) Yet what will they alledge for vvarrant of their ſeparation from us vvhich they haue made? Themſelues knovve that everie vvant or fayling in Churches or actions, vvill not beare out ſuch diviſions. Good vvarrant it had need be that ſhould uphold ſuch disbounding and ſeparating of themſelues, as they haue runne into.</p>
            <p>If they alledge the matters that are mentioned in the foreſayd letters vvhich they ſent into England, and in the other vvriting of theirs, vvhich is printed: for them you ſee the aunſvver novv given thereunto: and let them remember alſo, that hovvſoeuer they ſpeake of other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet they made their diviſion onely for the queſtion,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19231:47"/>about Government and the underſtanding of <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> vvhereabout we differed and could not agree. And if then in the matter it ſelf, for vvhich they left communion with us, they be found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be in notable errour: what vvarrant may it be that they can alledge herein, which will not returne upon their owne heads in the end, as that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth vvhich they alledge for and at their dividing of themſelues from us? <hi>Rom. 16, 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>long diſputing of theſe matters,</hi> vvhereof they ſpeak, that alſo maketh the more againſt them, becauſe that although ſuch care and continuall paynes vvas taken for them and vvith them, yet it prevayled nothing at all with them neyther. And vvhere they ſay, <hi>no waie of peace could by us be found to continew together in the truth &amp; holynes,</hi> they ſhould turne their eyes upon themſelues, upon their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and upon their ſtubberne contentious and unruly vvalking: beſides that they ſtayed not to ſee vvhat iſſue it vvould pleaſe God to bring of the matters in hand betvvee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other Church and us: and refuſed alſo to trie if by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting among our ſelues, vve could haue come to better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in our differences, then vve could by ſpeach and word of mouth. VVhich although it be a meanes ſeldome uſed vvhen parties are preſent together, and carefully to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded vvhen and hovv it is ſo uſed: yet I ſuppoſe novv that they haue better bethought themſelues, they vvill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge it had ben better to haue admitted of any lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes they could, rather then to haue divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as they did, and to haue brought ſo great reproach &amp; many evils upon themſelues and others as they haue done, Or if they vvill not ſo acknovvledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, yet I doubt not but others vvill for them.</p>
            <p>For that vvhich they ſpeak of the <hi>lamentable diſſipation of the Church and members beginning to growe,</hi> if they had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any particulars thereabout, they might accordingly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19231:47"/>haue ben ſpoken of. VVhich ſeeing they haue not done, I vvill leaue to the conſideration of themſelues &amp; others, whether their dealing &amp; departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us might not onely haue begunne, but even haue cauſed to growe and goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a moſt lamentable diſſipation of this Church, &amp; the members thereof, had not God diſappointed them, and in mercie ſuſteyned and kept us together, vvhen they made their diviſion &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted ſo great offence in this Church:<note place="margin">Rom. 16.17.</note> contrarie to the doctrine, vvhich vve haue learned of the Prophets and Apoſtles; vvhich vve alſo ſhevved unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many times, afore they parted from us; and vvhich (novv that they haue left us) muſt ende all the queſtion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie that is betvveen us.</p>
            <p>And here it is to be remembred, that alvvayes and in all our vvritings and occaſions vve ſtill profeſſe to haue the vvord of God alone for the light of our feet and direction of our vvayes, in all things. VVhich vve ſhould therefore be the more carefull to follovv, as it pleaſeth God of his goodnes to manifeſt his vvill unto us more &amp; more. And likevviſe about theſe matters, and in the laſt letter afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, vve limited our dealing and the reaſons alledged, with the ſame caution ſtill, of follovving <hi>that which we ſhould among our ſelues or by others best diſcerne to be according to the wil of God therein:</hi> VVhich though it had not ben expreſſed, ſhould alvvay be underſtood. But being purpoſely and ſo often mentioned from time to time, about theſe things, it ſhould the more be remembred &amp; regarded of us all: that by it vve may examine &amp; determine all the matters betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us. For neyther may vve reteyne any thing in the Church, nor yeeld to any agreement vvith others, that is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable by the vvord of God: neyther ſhould they urge the continuance of any thing among us, nor follow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues any courſe in their practiſe, that cannot by it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: but vve ſhould ſtill grovve in knovvledge &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19231:48"/>of the vvill of God, leaving that vvhich is evill, and following that vvhich is good, in all things.</p>
            <p>Moſes, when he was informed by Iethro that the courſe of government, vvhich he took in judging the people and hearing their cauſes ſo as he did, vvas not good, but vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſome both to him and the people, and had another vvay ſhewed unto him, to be received vvith the approbation of God: he vvillingly hearkened unto it, and chaunged his former courſe, the Lord alſo approving the ſame. <hi>Exod. 18.13-26.</hi> VVhen David in a godly deſire vvas carefull to bring the Arke of God from Kirja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h-jearim to Ieruſalem, he put it in a nevve cart, and beganne to carry it vvith ſinging and playing on inſtruments and great ſolemnity: thinking that he had done vvell and right therein: but the Lord made a breach upon them by the death of Vzza. VVhereupon David ſtayed the further removing of it a vvhile: and perceiving that it was, becauſe they did it not in the due order thereof, he then aftervvard took another courſe, appoynting the Levites to beare it, whom the Lord had choſen to cary the Arke of the Lord, and miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. <hi>1 Chron. 13. and 15.2-13. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Novv vvhat breaches, contentions, and continuall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, had ben at that time in this Church among us, they are not ignorant of: beſides the exceeding great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie one, which about the ſame time befell that other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of our countrymen here, who about the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Churches government, pleaded alſo againſt the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, for their popular courſe, vvith ſome of the verie ſame arguments, and other like, as theſe haue done; and runne into ſundrie Anabaptiſticall opinions and courſes, not unknovven unto them: And the brethren of Leyden in their letter here before make mention of <hi>our dayly diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations</hi> vvhich then vve had. VVhich things I note here by this occaſion, that it may the better appeare, both what
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19231:48"/>great cauſe vve had novv to look hereunto, and that theſe things alſo befell us, vvhiles vve held that courſe of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement pleaded for by theſe men, and afore they made this ſchiſmaticall departing from us, as novv they did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vve vvould not ſtill continue and hold on the ſame courſe, as before.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe examples of Moſes and David, I could alſo alledge the Apoſtles, vvho upon experience of evils that came by having younger vvidovves in the ſervice of the Church, took aftervvard another courſe, and appoynted that none ſhould be taken into that number under three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeere old, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Tim. 5, 9-15.</hi> And for chaunging of things purpoſed and determined, vvhen there is juſt cauſe, vve haue likevviſe the example of David agayne, vvho vvhen he had purpoſed and ſolemnely vovved the death of Nabal and all his familie, yet afterward upon the perſvvaſion and reaſons uſed by Abigail, changed his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and bleſſed her, and the Lord, for her counſel &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvaſion given unto him: <hi>1 Sam. 25.21-35.</hi> And of the Prophet Nathan, vvho having both conſented to Davids purpoſe of buylding an houſe to the Lord, and encouraged him thereunto, yet vvhen as the ſame night the Lord ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him, that he did not require it of David, neyther vvould haue him to doe it: he thereupon vvent and ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vved it to David; vvho alſo reſted therein, with praiſe and thanks unto God. <hi>1 Chron. 17. chap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe things are vvritten for our learning, vvhich I doe the rather note here, conſidering the perſons &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſpoken of: The perſons being Moſes, David, Nathan, Paul: ſome Prophets, ſome Apoſtles: The matters being touching the government of the people, the vvorſhip of God, the ſervice of the Church, and helping one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet ſuch perſons in ſuch matters altered their courſes and purpoſes, and vvere readie and vvilling ſo to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19231:49"/>doe, when eyther by the counſel of others, or by their own experience, or by the vvord or work of God, they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any errour to be committed, or ſome other evil to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, in the courſes taken or purpoſes intended by them. They knevve and vvere carefull as (all ſhould) that in all things, vvhether concerning the vvorſhip of God, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement of the Church, or other duties and actions, that onely ſhould be received and reteyned, vvhich is approved of God: and whatſoever is evill or unvvarrantable by his vvord (though formerly had and obſerved) that it ſhould be corrected and amended.</p>
            <p>According to vvhich rule, and examples of the godly in former times, if theſe men vvould novv (vvithout preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice) examine their opinions and courſes aforeſaid, they ſhould finde it high time for them to make a ſtand, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the vvork of God upon them, &amp; to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues no reſt till they haue forſaken their errours &amp; redreſſed their crooked waies: be they othervviſe never ſo pleaſing unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or auncient with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So ſhould they in deed keep the auncient fayth, and vvalk in the old and good vvay preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of God. Let them therefore hearken to the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and counſel given unto them: Let the vvaie of God be in their heart, and his feare before their eyes: Let them thinke on their owne vvaies, and turne their feet unto his teſtimonies: Let them make haſt, and not delay to keepe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmandements. <hi>Pſal. 119.59.60.</hi>

                  <item>2. of the charge layd upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Elders over the flock committed unto them by the Lord; and of the dutie required of the people agayne tovvards the Governours, vvhom the Lord ſets over them
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19231:49"/>in his ſtead.</item>
               </list>
Of the firſt I haue treated here, and in another treatiſe before, written about the expoſition of <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi> For the latter, ſee theſe &amp; the like Scriptures, throughout the book of God; <hi>Exod. 20, 12. 2 Chron. 26.16-21. Act. 20, 17, 28. Rom. 12, 3-8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. Epheſ. 4, 11-16. Col. 4, 17. 1 Theſ. 5, 12, 13. 1 Tim. 5, 17-21. and 6, 13.14. Tit. 2, 15. Iam. 5, 14. 1 Pet. 5, 1-4. Rev. 2, &amp; 3. Heb. 13, 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And novv to conclude, beſides all the former things, we entreated them alſo that ſeing the ſame matter vvas then in hand both betvveene <hi>Mr. Amſworth and Mr. Bernard,</hi> and betvveene <hi>Mr. Robinſon, and Mr. Bernard,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they vvould ſtay, to ſee vvhat this vvay might come to paſſe for the more clearing of the poynts in difference betvveen us, and our better accord thereabout: But they vvould not be perſwaded ſo to doe. And then finally, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a yeeres diſpute publikly had by vvord of mouth,<note place="margin">Once a vveek co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly.</note> &amp; all the other meanes uſed among us, I offered in the end (as I ſaid before) to try out the matter in vvriting betvveen us, and gaue forth unto them the obſervations vvhich then I had collected about <hi>Mat. 18.17.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Which ſince are printed.</note> VVhich they both heard publikely read, and had them to copy out, afore they went avvay from us: yet vvould they not yeeld hereunto: But vvhen vve had appoynted another day in the vveeke about theſe things, then had they ſome ſpeach of divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the foreſaid vvriting, vvhereabout alſo vve ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne: and ſo ſome ſpeach paſſed between us thereabout: but to giue anſvver unto it in vvriting they vvould not be perſwaded.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19231:51"/>hovv it hath ben ſhevved that the ſpeaches of <hi>telling the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and of <hi>the caſting out of perſons for deſpiſing the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition given by the Elders onely,</hi> are to be underſtood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of miniſtration and governement committed unto them by Chriſt and the Church, and not ſo to be taken, as to exclude the Church or Chriſt the head, for vvhom they doe adminiſter: but that vve ſhould alvvay underſtand &amp; obſerue theſe things, according as in Iſrael (in the due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and perpetuall equitie thereof) and according to the Scriptures here alledged, in this and the other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar aforeſayd: and therefore not to abridge the brethren of their aſſent or any right that doth apperteyne unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the vvord of God: but to doe all things according to the rules preſcribed therein, as before hath ben ſhevved. To vvhich ende likevviſe it is to be remembred, how it hath ben often ſignified and declared, that the povver of the holy things of God given to the Church, is properly and primarily Chriſts; ſecundarily and by communication the Churches; inſtrumentally and miniſterially the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, vvho are the Miniſters of Chriſt and the Church. And that thus vve would ſtill be underſtood. As alſo, that thus the admonition, being given as is aforeſayd, may be ſayd to be the admonition of Chriſt, of the Church, &amp; of the Elders, in divers reſpects, according as is ſayd before.)</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that rule in general, we have had this errour among us, that it hath ben underſtood to be a newe rule for the time of the Goſpel, which Iſrael had not. VVhereabout may be conſidered &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared together theſe and the like Scriptures, as followeth: <hi>Mat. 18.15. with Lev. 19, 17. Prov. 25.9.10.

            <p>And for all theſe things, if any can ſhew us better or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervviſe by the vvord of God, vve ſhall (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) be readie to yeeld unto it.</p>
            <p>THus vvas the Churches agreement about theſe things. VVhere note, that the firſt of theſe <hi>about admonition by the Elders,</hi> was ſooner agreed upon, there being but fevv (in reſpect) that excepted and ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, vvhen ſome of the chief of them yeelded unto it. The latter, <hi>about our practiſe, &amp; underſtanding of Mat. 18, 17.</hi> was verie long debated among us: and after much reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had thereabout, vve vvere often and earneſtly urged by the Oppoſites, to giue ſentence and come to an yſſue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. So in the end vve agreed concerning it, as here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſet dovvne. VVhich vvhen vve had done, they ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifyed their diſſent, and that they could no longer vvalke vvith us, practiſing accordingly. And ſo aftervvard they vvent avvay and left us. And this is the very cauſe of their departing from us, vvhatſoever other thing be alledged by them or any other thereabout.</p>
            <p>And this I intreat the Reader vvell to obſerue, becauſe othervviſe, reading their foreſayd differences and objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the letter and printed copie, (vvhereabout they haue buſied themſelues ſo much) he may take them for cauſes of their ſeparation, which in deed vvere not. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thus it pleaſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to trouble mens mindes with their poſitions, and intend in the ſetting of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dovvne to cauſe diſgrace to this poor Church (which they ſo unjuſtly haue left, as if we had apoſtated and left the auncient ſayth) it ſhall be good for them to try and warrant thoſe their poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19231:52"/>and differences, as alſo their ſeparation from us, by the touchſtone of the vvord of God, as now by the anſwer thereunto given, they are occaſioned to doe.</p>
            <p>And vvithall, let them ſhew out of the Scripture, hovv it can be vvarranted, that a miniſter vvho hath not himſelf received true baptiſme, may adminiſter the Lords Supper; or that a people not having true baptiſme, may receive the Lords ſupper (as theſe haue done): ſeeing themſelues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the baptiſme of the Church of Rome,<note place="margin">By this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Martyrs of later yeeres had not true ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, &amp;c.</note> &amp; ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of other Churches in Apoſtaſie, to be <hi>true baptiſme.</hi> If the example of Chriſt be conſidered, vvho firſt inſtituted and miniſtred the Lords ſupper himſelf, he had received true baptiſme before. <hi>Mat. 3, 16. with 26.26.27.28.</hi> The like may be obſerved about his Apoſtles, &amp; namely about Paul, vvho vvas firſt baptiſed, afore he received or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the Lords ſupper: <hi>Act. 9.18. with 20.11.</hi> and ſo in others from time to time. By vvhich themſelues may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vvhat a continuall profanation of Gods holy things is among them, that ſo miniſter or receiue, not having true baptiſme: and the Reader may diſcerne hovv needfull it had ben for them, better to haue thought of their poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and objections againſt us, afore they had thus vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and given them forth. And this I thought good here to mention (together vvith that vvhich is before noted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it) that both themſelues and others may by this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion duly conſider of their eſtate and dealing.<note place="margin">Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <head type="sub">Lib. ſingulari de Eccleſ. contra Bellarminum, cap. 17. And in his vvorks printed in fol. p. 1018.1019. &amp;c.</head>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing to treat of the Church of Rome, vve wil firſt unty the knot of the aequivocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word, before we determine of the thing it ſelf; that all men may better perceiue, what it is, that is at this day called in queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. For very many are deceived vvith the homonymie or aequivocation of the verie word, and unavvares inſnare themſelues and others, by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the deceitfulnes in the ſpeach.</p>
            <p>The church of Rome therefore is properly ſo called, or abuſiuely, by the miſterming or abuſing of the name; both as it is called a church, &amp; as it is called the Romane church. For as it is called the Romane church, ſometymes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifyeth the companie vvhich is at Rome, as Paul ſpake, vvriting to the Romanes: ſometimes it ſignifieth abuſiuely, all the churches on the earth, that cleaue to the Romane church, according to the forme of doctrine, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19231:53"/>conſtitution thereof. But vve vvill treat of the church as it is indeede the church of Rome: and the things vvhich vve ſhall ſpeak of this church, the ſame may the godly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by proportion underſtand of the church ſo called by abuſe of ſpeach.</p>
            <p>Now as it is called a Church (vvhich thing chiefly is in controverſie) it is ſo termed three maner of vvayes: as a ſubject; as an accident growing to the ſubject; and as the ſubject together vvith that his accident. As a <hi>ſubject,</hi> it is the ſimple or ſingle Church of Rome; As <hi>an accident grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſubject,</hi> is the papacie, or the papall hierarchie, vvhich they call <hi>eccleſiaſticall.</hi> As <hi>a ſubject compounded with his accident,</hi> it is the church of Rome become papall, or under the Pope, that is to ſay corrupt, as I may ſo ſpeake, by that lavvles or unnaturall ſhoot of the Pope, ſpringing out of the ſtock. Novv of each of theſe vve vvill conſider ſo briefly as may be, one after another.</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome when it is conſidered as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it hath tvvo parts; the paſtors and the flock of Chriſt:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for vvhich church the Apoſtle of old gaue thanks to God by Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe her fayth vvas publiſhed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the vvhole vvorld. <hi>Rom. 1, 8.</hi> And for vvhich vve alſo dayly aske of God in our prayers, that he vvould informe it to vvorſhip him by his ſpirit in the Goſpel of his ſonne, &amp; to eſtabliſh it in fayth. Neyther doe vve deny this ſubject to be at Rome, by the mercie of God, even at this day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vve truſt there is God calling, perſons called, and the calling it ſelf yet in her: the meeting of vvhich things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one giveth being to a church,<note place="margin">Chap. 8. &amp;c.</note> as before vve ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</p>
            <p>But touching the papacie, or the papall hierarchie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> which they are vvoont to call <hi>eccleſiaſticall,</hi> vve doe not ſay that it is the church properly ſo called, but an accident grovving unto the church, and ſuch as covertly vvorketh
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19231:54"/>againſt the life, and health of the Church. That it is not the church properly, is proved by the very definition of the papacie, and of the Church of God. For the papacie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his generall, is an order: the church is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie or an aſſemblie. The papacie by his difference, is an order poſitiue, humane or from men, and naught; The church is an aſſemblie divine or from God, by divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, vvith reaſon united together. Novv thoſe things which differ both in their generall, and in their eſſentiall difference, and in their neceſſarie conditions or properties, they cannot be one and the ſame thing. And that <hi>the papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> is an accident grovving upon the Church, experience it ſelf ſpeaketh. For the ſubject is before his accident, which is contigent and ſeparable: The church vvas many ages vvhen the papacie vvas not: The papacie came to the church contingently <hi>(beſide the being of the Church)</hi> and ſo may be ſeparated from it, as at this time alſo there are chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, vvhere the papacie is not, &amp; there vvill be churches ſtill hereafter vvithout the papacie. Therefore the papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is not the church, but it is an evill grovving up in the church, a peſtilence, a dropſie, the gangrene in the bodie, deceiptfully working againſt the life and health of it, and therefore moſt noyſomely eating up the liuely and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome moyſture of the church. But of this vvhole matter, vve haue ſpoken in the <hi>3. Controverſie,</hi> &amp; in this fourth we are to ſpeak of it hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Therefore concerning the other vvhich remayneth let us ſee, whether the papall Romane church, or that which is of the pope, be the church. The opinions vvhich are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter are divers. The popiſh generation cry out vvith full mouth, that it is abſolutely the church. Others not beholding a different regard of the papacie, from that vvhich is the church, deny it to be the church. VVe rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both on the nature of the thing, and on the authoritie
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19231:54"/>of the Scripture, doe put a difference. The nature of the thing doth teach, that the church is one thing, and that the papacie is another, as vve ſpake a litle before. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Scripture teacheth the church, but it teacheth not the papacie: therefore they are divers things. For they delude undoubtedly, I ſay they delude, vvhich require at our hands one definition of the ſubject &amp; of the accident, as of one ſingular thing, or obtrude it on us. For thus muſt vve ſay, The papall church, as it hath that in it vvhich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the definition of a church, it is a church; but as it hath in it the evill grovven unto it, which vve call <hi>the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie,</hi> in that reſpect it is not a church, but a faultie, deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and a corrupt church, and dravving on to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Let us make it playne by a ſimilitude. The bodie it ſelf is one thing, the corruption or putrefaction in the bodie another thing, and the corrupted or puttrefied bodie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. The bodie is the ſubject, the corruption or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction is the evill accident cleaving unto the ſubject, the corrupted or putrifyed bodie is compounded of them both. There is both the bodie, and putrefaction in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified bodie. So is a bodie that is ſvvolne vvith the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cauſing the dropſie. Both are together, and yet ſo toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as eyther one of the two, or both together muſt needs periſh. If the nature of the bodie be ſtronger, the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and dropſie vvater decayeth: but if the corruption or dropſie prevayle, there is moſt certaine deſtruction of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. So is the church of God: for in it ſelf it is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Ieſus Chriſt. If a deadly diſeaſe grovve upon it, both are then together, the bodie and the diſeaſe in the bodie. If the purging medicine of the grace of God (for nothing is here naturall) be of the more efficacie, the diſeaſe then is vanquiſhed and decayeth: but if the diſeaſe prevayle, then both of them (the bodie and the diſeaſe) muſt needs come to an end. For ſuch is the condition of the diſeaſe: it both
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19231:55"/>feedeth it ſelf on the dodie decaying, and deſtroyeth it ſelf together vvith the bodie.</p>
            <p>After this maner therfore doe we eſteeme of the church of Rome, vvhich they call the papall or popiſh Church. There is the Church, there is the papacie, and there is the papall Church. As there is the Church, it is the ſubject of God: as there is the papacie, there is the diſeaſe of man: as it is the papall church, there is a fight betvveen the church and the papacie, that will deſtroy eyther one of them apart, or both together. If God ſhall giue it the purging medicine of his grace, by meanes vvhereof the papacie, the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie evill decaye and periſh; it is vvell: but if the papacie, that moſt faultie and corrupt order, and deadly accident prevayle, it vvill bring deſtruction to both of them, both to the church and to it ſelf, by the judgment of God.</p>
            <p>And this novv in the memorie of our fathers and our ovvne vve ſee to haue befallen many churches, vvhich claue faſt unto that Romane church. For when it ſeemed good unto God more clearely to inkindle the torch of the goſpel, and to ſcatter the papall ſmokes by his ſpirit, there remayned churches returning by his grace to a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and ſtronger health, &amp; that vvhich is of the pope departeth vaniſhing avvay through his ovvne corruption: but when as God ſent not that purging medicine of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace into the bodie of any church, then the popiſh corrupt blood got ſtrength more and more, which vvill be to that church deadly deſtruction, unles God of his mercie provide a remedie. In the remembrance and conſcience of this benefit, doe our churches fitly ſing vvith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Bleſſed, be the Lord which hath not giuen us for a praye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their teeth. Our ſoule is eſcaped even as a bird out of the ſnare of the foulers: the ſnare is broken, and we are delivered. Our help is in the name of the Lord, &amp;c. Pſal. 124.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVherefore in my judgment they ſpeak prepoſterouſly,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19231:55"/>vvho aske vvhether the church be in the papacie: becauſe on the contrarie it ſhould be asked, vvhether the papacie be in the church. For the ſubject is not in the, accident, but the accident in the ſubject, vvhoſe being, is an in being, or to be in a thing, as men commonly ſpeake. And that the papacie is in the church, as the order or eſtate of apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the houſe and citie of God, is as certaine, as that of the Apoſtle is certaine, <hi>2 Theſ. 2. that the man of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition ſitteth in the temple of God,</hi> vvith his vvhole order or ranke of apoſtates: and not on the other ſide, that the temple of God conſiſteth in that order and number of apoſtates, vvhich is a thing moſt ſtraunge &amp; furtheſt off. But the terme of the papacie taken doubly and aequivocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deceiveth them in ſuch fort as here before vve ſhevved concerning the Romane popiſh Church. For under the name of the papacie (vvhich is a foule corrupt order) they comprehend the ſubject it ſelf, which is annoyed vvith that corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not diſtinguiſhing aright between theſe things.</p>
            <p>As therfore, if any ſhould deny that to be a bodie, which lyeth in a deadly ſort ſvvollen vvith the vvater of the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or ſhould affirme that vvater which choketh the bodie, to be the bodie it ſelf, ſhould in both theſe be deceived in his judgment: ſo alſo are both deceived, as vvell they vvhich deny it to be the church, becauſe the papacie is in it, as they vvhich avouch the papacie to be the church it ſelf, vvhich we haue before diſproved. The papacie is a poyſon in the church, vvhich poyſon muſt needs be vomited out, if it vvill be preſerved: or els the church vvill be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by it, if it ſuffer that poyſon to prevayle, and poſſeſſe all the veynes of the bodie.</p>
            <p>But how can ſhe be the church, (will ſome ſay) in which the papacie is? To witte, as there is the bodie, in which a diſeaſe vvorketh. But becauſe the papacie is a deadly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the more that the papacie getteth ſtrength, the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19231:56"/>more the church is vveakned: the increaſe of the one, is the decreaſe of the other. And hence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that in the churches vvhich are called popiſh, ſome are more healthie, &amp; ſome more unhealthie then others: the more healthie are thoſe, which haue leſſe of the papacie, &amp; more of the church: and thoſe are the more unhealthie which haue more of the papacie &amp; leſſe of the church: and of this kinde, I doubt not that church to be, vvhich at this day is at Rome. For it had long agoe giuen up the ghoſt, if God by the impoſition of his grace and long ſuffring had not nouriſhed and kept it vvarme.</p>
            <p>Notvvithſtanding that vve may giue content unto their mindes, vvhich doe not yet reach unto theſe things, or thinke that they are more ſubtily then truly ſpoken of the church vvhich they call the papall or popiſh church: let us anſvver this queſtion in fevv vvords, from the regard of all particular churches, as they are among men, or in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of things humane. Everie church, vvhich in deed is a Church, is conſidered tvvo vvayes, on Gods behalf (as they ſpeake) and on our behalf. On Gods behalf, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a church, vvhereſoever there is found a companie called of God, vvith his calling by the ſpirit and the holie Scripture, and the miniſterie of perſons ordeyned for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie things, and divine actions. On our behalf there is no Church at all, (although it be ſo of God, as vve haue ſayd) to vvhich there doth not cleaue corruption, concerning the perſons, things, actions, and finally the vvhole miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of man ordeyned by God. And that vvhich is on Gods part, is not taken away by our default, ſo long as it ſeemeth good unto the Lord, to acknovvledge it for his Church, &amp; call it with his calling, by the ſpirit, &amp; holie Scripture, &amp; the miniſterie. For <hi>ſhall the unbeleeſ of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Ro. 3.3.</hi>) <hi>make the ſayth of God without effect?</hi> ſhal the vveak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make voyde the truth of God? or his imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:19231:56"/>the perfection of God? <hi>Farre be it off: yea let God be true &amp; everie man a lyer,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle in the ſame place.</p>
            <p>VVe vvill make the matter playne by an example and ſimilitude out of the vvords of Ieremie, <hi>chap. 3.</hi> A vvife being filthie vvith adulteries, if her husband vvill pardon her, and conſent to receiue her, and to dvvell vvith her, ſhe abideth ſtill the vvife of her husband, not by her ovvne deede doone (for ſhe hath broken wedlock, vvhat in her vvas) but by the benefit or goodnes of her husband. So a Church overflovving not onely vvith lighter infirmities, but alſo vvith heavie adulteries, on her part in deed ſhould ceaſe to be a vvife, but ſhe ceaſeth not on her husbands part. For <hi>touching the election,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Rom. 11.28. ſhe is beloved for the fathers ſakes,</hi> ſpeaking of the church of the Iewes. It is a church ſo long as God calling her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymeth that vvhich is in <hi>Ier. 3.13. Onely acknowledge thine iniquitie, that thou hast tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord thy God, and hast ſcattered thy waies to the ſtraungers under everie green tree, and ye haue not obeyed my voyce, ſayth the Lord. Turne, ô backſlyding people, ſayth the Lord, for I am maryed unto you, &amp; I will take you &amp;c.</hi> It is ſo long a church, as God proteſting calleth upon it departing from him and being rebellious, as it is in <hi>Eſa. 50, 1. Where is the bil of your mothers diverce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherewith I put her away? or who is there of my credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to whom I ſould you? &amp;c.</hi> The church then at length ceaſeth to be a church, vvhen God ceaſeth to call it back, &amp; taketh avvay the evidence of that holie marriage, that is, the holie Scripture, out of the hand of the adulteres, and her that is ſtubburne, teſtifying that the matrimonie is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on his part, and ſo receiveth the covenant of grace unto himſelf. It is not for any man, to deny that to be a church, which God calleth a church. Neyther is it for any man, to call that a church, vvhich God, having giuen the bil of divorce, and taken avvay the draught of the mariage
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19231:57"/>contract, denyeth ſo to be.</p>
            <p>And after this maner doe vve eſteeme of the Church in vvhich the papacie is. God calleth her vvith his calling, by his ſpirit, and vvord, and the publike records of that holie mariage (vvhich vve call the holie Scripture) and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, and things, and holy actions, vvhich before vve haue briefly reckoned up. Theſe things doe remayne to that church moſt manifeſtly, on Gods behalf. But in that on the behalf of men all theſe things and holie actions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vvith the verie perſons themſelues, abound and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflovve, vvith moſt grievous &amp; deadly corruptions, that is the ſinne of men, not the fault of God; vvhoſe grace &amp; truth is perfected in infirmitie. On Gods part, ſhe is yet called <hi>Hammi, my people,</hi> and <hi>Ruchama, finding mercie,</hi> which moſt truly on her part, might be called <hi>Lo hammi, not my people,</hi> and <hi>Lo ruchama, not obteyning mercie,</hi> as vve read in Hoſea the Prophet. But vve rely upon the mercie of God, and according to his grace revealed, vve ſpeake our minde, or vve giue our ſentence concerning a church erring and going aſtray.</p>
            <p>But this Church hath everie thing in it corrupt. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it. But in that it hath all the divine things in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is of God: in that it hath them all corrupt, that is of it ſelf: in that it hath all the divine things, it is a church, in that it hath the ſame all corrupt, it is a corrupt church. The church is not taken avvay by corruption, unles it be totall (as they ſpeak) vvhich they call deſtruction. A cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in part doth not take avvay a Church, but vveaken it. The Church of Rome hath all things corrupt, but not altogether: this is not a deſtruction, but is to be called a corruption of it in part.</p>
            <p>For (to proſecute theſe heads particularly, vvhich vvee haue briefly noted in the conſideration of the Church) God by the alone preſence of himſelf calling, doth lay the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19231:57"/>foundation of the Church, in Chriſt the head thereof. The church of Rome addeth another foundation to this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and to this head another nevv head (vvhereupon it is called papall or popiſh) vvherein it may likevviſe reſt. The calling is to God alone; in the church of Rome there is calling to others vvith God, and the calling upon them. Here is calling by the ſpirit and Scripture alone, vvhence it receiveth the miniſterie, &amp; delivereth nothing more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that vvhich it hath received from the Lord: there it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a miniſterie from the ſpirit of Chriſt, &amp; of the Pope, from the Scripture, and the ragged traditions of men: here finally the perſons, things and actions are caried, according to the doctrine of the Spirit, &amp; the Scripture onely: there all things are taken and exerciſed out of the Popes change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhoppe, and at his beck (as they ſay) they ſtand and fall. So all the marks on Gods behalf are in it: but for it ſelf, on it ovvne part (as they ſay) there is no marke intire, no marke that is not corrupt by the papall poyſonfull ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie, and the order of all things moſt miſerably perverted. For vvhich cauſe in Lyons in France, a certayne Frier did merrily preach to the people, vvhen he ſayd the Hugonots (for ſo they are called in France) did conſent vvith the church of Rome in all their articles of fayth, but there was one ſhrevvd vvord, the vvord <hi>Onely,</hi> at the crack vvhereof vvarre vvas inkindled, for they beleeue onely vvhat the rule of fayth hath out of the holie Scriptures: but the church of Rome requireth more unto fayth then is eyther conteyned in the rule of fayth, or in the holie Scriptures, becauſe ſuch is the authoritie of the Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being vvell underſtood, all men vvill ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely perceiue hovv that church, in reſpect of God or on Gods part, is yet a church; but of it ſelf is moſt corrupt, &amp; very nere to deſtruction. But here doe ariſe tvvo doubts &amp; difficulties, by vvhich the mindes of many are troubled.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19231:58"/>The firſt doubt is, vvhat vve are to judge of the members of that church: The latter vvhat the dutie of them is vvho are in that church, and ſee the great corruptions thereof.</p>
            <p>To the firſt queſtion we anſvver on this manner. A threefold judgment had neede meet together in this cauſe: the firſt, of truth; the ſecond, of charitie; the third, of prudence or vviſdome. The judgment of truth is of the common condition of the church, by vvhich vve judge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the calling of God, that as yet ſhe is a church. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charitie is of the ſeverall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the church, by vvhich we preſume they be members of the church, whilſt they are called vvith the calling of God, and are in this way as David calleth it <hi>Pſal. 2.</hi> The judgement of prudence or vviſdome, is that by vvhich vve diſcerne and diſtinguiſh perſons, things and actions divine from humane, good ones from evill, true ones from falſe, and the degrees of theſe alſo amongſt themſelues. For as of things &amp; actions, ſo alſo of perſons ſome are corrupting through ignorance infirmitie, or malice vvholly, or in part; others are corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, euen in the ſimplicitie of their hearts as the Scripture ſpeaketh: and of theſe there are a great number, of vvhom it vvere ungodly to eſteeme that they vvere not of the church of God. Of ſuch as doe corrupt we muſt take heed, <hi>Mat. 7.</hi> of the corrupted, vvho yet are ſtill corrupted vve muſt haue compaſſion. But the Church verely is not to be judged of the maner of either of theſe. for Chriſt ſaith not, ye ſhall not knovve the Church, but <hi>by their fruits</hi> of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and life <hi>ye ſhall knowe them, Mat. 7.20.</hi> And vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, they doe very unvviſely who judge of the truth of a church, by the particular life or doctrine of any men, vvho ever they be, eſpecially of private men: for the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God maketh the church, not the aſſenting anſvver of the men that are in it: as on the other ſide the church ceaſeth not to be a church for the refuſal, or denial of men,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19231:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>vvhereſoever the calling of God is. Novv let us come to the ſecond demaund.</p>
            <p>VVhat is the dutie of thoſe (vvilt thou ſay) that are in the Popiſh Church, and ſee the grievous corruptions of it? Their dutie is ſuch as of thoſe children, vvhich dvvell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vvith their adulterous mother: for God uſed this ſimilitude in Eſaie and Ieremie, as vve haue ſeene before. A vviſe ſonne vvill even from his heart abhorre the ſinne of his mother, he vvill vvith ſpeach and ſigne call back his mother from evil, and he vvill abſteyne himſelf from it: and in all things he vvill cleaue to his father, he vvill ſtand to his judgement, he vvill obey his vvil: and vvhile he can by reaſon of his mother, he vvill cleaue unto her, next after his father: but vvhiles by reaſon of her he can not doe it vvith good conſcience, for the ſpirituall and bodily injurie of her,<note place="margin">Cloſet or Inner roome.</note> he vvill betake himſelf into the chamber of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vvhere alſo the church is the mother of us all. <hi>Gal. 4.26.</hi> For this is not a good conſequent, if one depart from this or that church, therefore he doth altogether departe from the church. He but trifles vvho doth ſo from a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, conclude univerſally. A part of the fleſh if it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided or cut aſunder from another part by a vvound recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is not ſtraight vvay to be thought to be ſeparate or cut off from the vvhole bodie: for it is cutte aſunder, and the mouth of the vvound openeth, but neyther part is therfore diſjoyned from the bodie. A godly ſonne therefore ought to cleaue to his father and mother joyntly, ſo long as vvith good conſcience he can: but becauſe he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not vvith ſound fayth and conſcience haue fellovvſhip with the unfrutefull vvorks of darkenes, <hi>Eph. 5, 11.</hi> he rather leaving his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cleaveth to God his father, &amp; our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, then that he vvill defile himſelf vvith thoſe foule deedes of his mother.</p>
            <p>And this did our aunceſtors religiouſly, vvhom the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19231:59"/>tyrannie for ſome ages hath exerciſed. The godly vvhich vvere at Rome, and other vvhere in the church vvhich they call the Romane church abuſiuely, firſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to abhorre even from their ſoule, the ſinnes of their mother, vvhen once they began to haue right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; by vvords and ſignes they modeſtly called her back from her naughtie deeds, vvhiles ſhe vvould beare them, they carefully abſteyned themſelues from all communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evill, yet in all things cleaving to their father, from vvhom, in vvhom, by vvhom, &amp; for whom are all things, ſtanding to his judgment, and obeying his vvill: finally they did ſo long cleaue to their mother next after their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vvhilſt by her they could ſo doe vvith intire fayth and conſcience, and their ovvne ſalvation. But vvhen they could not longer vvith good fayth and conſcience ſo doe, by reaſon of the violent tyrannie, and the ſpirituall &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall injurie of their furious mother, then being aſhamed with her ſhamefulnes &amp; reſting ſilent, they betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into their fathers boſome and his inner roome, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that ſhe purſued them outragiouſly: leaſt they being aſhamed of her, ſhould be ſayd to ſhame her, as ſtrumpets are uſually vvoont to doe.</p>
            <p>For which cauſes, I doe humbly beſeech God the Father of our Lord Ieſus, that he would both by his ſaving calling informe, direct and care for his church, and vvhatſoever belongeth to his church, &amp; that he would alſo teach everie one that is in it his truth, and the truth of his church: and that he vvould ſo vvorke, as they vviſely abſteyning from all evils, eſpecially from thoſe vvhich the ſonne of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and author of the apoſtaſie hath brought in, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heed of the ſpirit of lyes, &amp; the efficacie of his errour, they may religiouſly cleaue unto the Father and his good things, in everie of them, and to their mother next after the father (or ſo farre as ſhe accordeth vvith the Father):
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19231:59"/>that increaſing in his truth, pietie, fayth &amp; loue they may beſtovve and employe all their ſtudies to the edification of the church, the ſalvation of all, and the glorie of that our heavenly Father. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

VVhich we vvould not haue thee ſo take it, as if we would ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv ſuch perſons vvith anſvver after anſvver, as novv vve haue done the ſecond time. VVe muſt remember both thoſe Proverbs of Salomon, vvhich he hath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4.5. one for <hi>anſwering,</hi> and an other for <hi>not anſwering:</hi> as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here before in the beginning.</p>
            <p>Neyther let any that loue the truth be moved or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged vvith the contumelies, oppoſitions, or other perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that vve or other the people of God are ſtill ſubject unto. If ſuch reproachfull courſes ſhould haue ben taken againſt Iacobs familie, againſt the people of Iſrael, againſt the Churches of Corinth, Galatia, &amp; others heretofore or at this daye, vvhat volumes &amp; invectines might be vvritten and ſpread over the vvorld from age to age? And if ſinnes and ſinners of all ſorts, ſhould not fall out and be found in the Church, vvhy appointed God ſuch lavves and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſinners in Iſrael, &amp; vvhy hath he given cenſures to his church ſtill to be had and continued therein from time to time? Finally, if vvhen men haue ſinned, neither the repentance of the penitent, nor the cenſures upon the impenitent ſhall be regarded or reſted in, but that both the perſons and churches that are carefull ſo to vvalk ſhall be thus abuſed, beſides all the lyes &amp; ſclanders annexed vvith all; vvhat may vve thinke, but that vve haue to deale with beaſts rather then men, or vvith <hi>Chams, Doegs, Schemeis, Rabſhakees, Sanballats,</hi> and the like. And vvhat can ſuch look for if they repent not, but that (as Peter ſayd) they ſhall utterly periſh in their ovvne corruption: and (as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid ſayd) that God vvill take &amp; pluck them out of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19231:67"/>and roote them out of the land of the living? <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.5.</p>
            <p>The Lord our God the God of glorie &amp; father of mercie work all our things to his praiſe &amp; furtherance of his truth, make us partakers of his grace &amp; mercie in Chriſt; turne al the enmitie and curſing of men into a favour and bleſſing upon us; increaſe in us the knovvledge &amp; obedience of his vvill in all godlines; ſtrengthen us in &amp; for his truth unto the end; &amp; after vve haue ſuffered here a vvhile, bring us to his heavenly reſt &amp; kingdome for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
